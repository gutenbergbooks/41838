<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>REASONING</small></h2>


<p>"Reasoning" is defined as: "The act,
process or art of exercising the faculty of reason;
the act or faculty of employing reason in
argument; argumentation, ratiocination; reasoning
power; disputation, discussion, argumentation."
Stewart says: "The word <i>reason</i>
itself is far from being precise in its meaning.
In common and popular discourse it denotes
that power by which we distinguish
truth from falsehood, and right from wrong,
and by which we are enabled to combine means
for the attainment of particular ends."</p>

<p>By the employment of the reasoning faculties
of the mind we compare objects presented
to the mind as percepts or concepts, taking up
the "raw materials" of thought and weaving
them into more complex and elaborate mental
fabrics which we call abstract and general
ideas of truth. Brooks says: "It is the thinking
power of the mind; the faculty which gives
us what has been called <i>thought-knowledge</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
distinction from <i>sense-knowledge</i>. It may be
regarded as the mental architect among the
faculties; it transforms the material furnished
by the senses ... into new products, and
thus builds up the temples of science and philosophy."
The last-mentioned authority adds:
"Its products are twofold, <i>ideas</i> and <i>thoughts</i>.
An <i>idea</i> is a mental product which when expressed
in words does not give a proposition;
a <i>thought</i> is a mental product which embraces
the relation of two or more ideas. The ideas
of the understanding are of two general
classes; abstract ideas and general ideas. The
thoughts are also of two general classes; those
pertaining to contingent truth and those pertaining
to necessary truth. In contingent
truth, we have <i>facts</i>, or immediate judgments,
and <i>general truths</i> including <i>laws</i> and <i>causes</i>,
derived from particular facts; in necessary
truth we have <i>axioms</i>, or self-evident truths,
and the truths derived from them by reasoning,
called <i>theorems</i>."</p>

<p>In inviting you to consider the processes of
reasoning, we are irresistibly reminded of the
old story of one of Moliere's plays in which
one of the characters expresses surprise on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
learning that he "had been talking prose for
forty years without knowing it." As Jevons
says in mentioning this: "Ninety-nine people
out of a hundred might be equally surprised
on hearing that they had been converting
propositions, syllogizing, falling into paralogisms,
framing hypotheses and making classifications
with genera and species. If asked
whether they were logicians, they would probably
answer, No! They would be partly right;
for I believe that a large number even of educated
persons have no clear idea of what logic
is. Yet, in a certain way, every one must have
been a logician since he began to speak."</p>

<p>So, in asking you to consider the processes
of reasoning we are not assuming that you
never have reasoned&mdash;on the contrary we are
fully aware that you in connection with every
other person, have reasoned all your mature
life. That is not the question. While everyone
reasons, the fact is equally true that the
majority of persons reason incorrectly. Many
persons reason along lines far from correct
and scientific, and suffer therefor and thereby.
Some writers have claimed that the majority
of persons are incapable of even fairly correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
reasoning, pointing to the absurd ideas entertained
by the masses of people as a proof of
the statement. These writers are probably
a little radical in their views and statements,
but one is often struck with wonder at the
evidences of incapacity for interpreting facts
and impressions on the part of the general
public. The masses of people accept the most
absurd ideas as truth, providing they are
gravely asserted by some one claiming authority.
The most illogical ideas are accepted
without dispute or examination, providing
they are stated solemnly and authoritatively.
Particularly in the respective fields of religion
and politics do we find this blind acceptance
of illogical ideas by the multitude. Mere
assertion by the leaders seems sufficient for
the multitude of followers to acquiesce.</p>

<p>In order to reason correctly it is not merely
necessary to have a good intellect. An athlete
may have the proper proportions, good framework,
and symmetrical muscles, but he cannot
expect to cope with others of his kind unless
he has learned to develop those muscles
and to use them to the best advantage. And,
in the same way, the man who wishes to reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
correctly must develop his intellectual faculties
and must also learn the art of using them
to the best advantage. Otherwise he will
waste his mental energy and will be placed at
a disadvantage when confronted with a
trained logician in argument or debate. One
who has witnessed a debate or argument between
two men equally strong intellectually,
one of whom is a trained logician and the other
lacking this advantage, will never forget the
impression produced upon him by the unequal
struggle. The conflict is like that of a powerful
wrestler, untrained in the little tricks and
turns of the science, in the various principles
of applying force in a certain way at a certain
time, at a certain place, with a trained and experienced
wrestler. Or of a conflict between
a muscular giant untrained in the art of boxing,
when confronted with a trained and experienced
exponent of "the manly art." The
result of any such conflict is assured in advance.
Therefore, everyone should refuse to
rest content without a knowledge of the art
of reasoning correctly, for otherwise he places
himself under a heavy handicap in the race
for success, and allows others, perhaps less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
well-equipped mentally, to have a decided advantage
over him.</p>

<p>Jevons says in this connection: "To be a
good logician is, however, far more valuable
than to be a good athlete; because logic teaches
us to reason well, and reasoning gives us
knowledge, and knowledge, as Lord Bacon
said, is power. As athletes, men cannot for a
moment compare with horses or tigers or
monkeys. Yet, with the power of knowledge,
men tame horses and shoot tigers and despise
monkeys. The weakest framework with the
most logical mind will conquer in the end, because
it is easy to foresee the future, to calculate
the result of actions, to avoid mistakes
which might be fatal, and to discover the
means of doing things which seemed impossible.
If such little creatures as ants had better
brains than men, they would either destroy
men or make them into slaves. It is true that
we cannot use our eyes and ears without
getting some kind of knowledge, and the brute
animals can do the same. But what gives
power is the deeper knowledge called Science.
People may see, and hear, and feel all
their lives without really learning the na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>ture
of things they see. But reason is the
mind's eye, and enables us to see why things
are, and when and how events may be made to
happen or not to happen. The logician endeavors
to learn exactly what this reason is
which makes the power of men. We all, as I
have said, must reason well or ill, but logic is
the science of reasoning and enables us to distinguish
between the good reasoning which
leads to truth, and the bad reasoning which
every day betrays people into error and misfortune."</p>

<p>In this volume we hope to be able to point
out the methods and principles of correctly
using the reasoning faculties of the mind, in a
plain, simple manner, devoid of useless technicalities
and academic discussion. We shall
adhere, in the main, to the principles established
by the best of the authorities of the old
school of psychology, blending the same with
those advanced by the best authorities of the
New Psychology. No attempt to make of this
book a school text-book shall be made, for our
sole object and aim is to bring this important
subject before the general public composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
people who have neither the time nor inclination
to indulge in technical discussion nor
academic hair-splitting, but who desire to understand
the underlying <i>working principles</i> of
the Laws of Reasoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE PROCESS OF REASONING</small></h2>


<p>The processes of Reasoning may be said to
comprise four general stages or steps, as
follows:</p>

<p>I. <i>Abstraction</i>, by which is meant the process
of <i>drawing off</i> and <i>setting aside</i> from an
object, person or thing, <i>a quality or attribute</i>,
and making of it a distinct object of thought.
For instance, if I perceive in a <i>lion</i> the quality
of <i>strength</i>, and am able to think of this quality
abstractly and independently of the animal&mdash;if
the term <i>strength</i> has an actual mental
meaning to me, independent of the lion&mdash;then
I have <i>abstracted</i> that quality; the thinking
thereof is an act of <i>abstraction</i>; and the
thought-idea itself is an <i>abstract idea</i>. Some
writers hold that these abstract ideas are realities,
and "not mere figments of fancy." As
Brooks says: "The rose dies, but my idea of
its color and fragrance remains." Other authorities
regard Abstraction as but an act of
<i>attention</i> concentrated upon but the particu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>lar
quality to the exclusion of others, and that
the abstract idea has no existence apart from
the general idea of the object in which it is
included. Sir William Hamilton says: "We
can rivet our attention on some particular
mode of a thing, as its smell, its color, its figure,
its size, etc., and abstract it from the others.
This may be called Modal Abstraction.
The abstraction we have now been considering
is performed on individual objects, and is consequently
particular. There is nothing necessarily
connected with generalization in abstraction;
generalization is indeed dependent
on abstraction, which it supposes; but abstraction
does not involve generalization."</p>

<p>II. <i>Generalization</i>, by which is meant the
process of forming Concepts or General Ideas.
It acts in the direction of apprehending the
common qualities of objects, persons and
things, and combining and uniting them into
a single notion or <i>conception</i> which will comprehend
and include them all. A General
Idea or Concept differs from a particular idea
in that it includes within itself the qualities of
the particular and other particulars, and accordingly
may be applied to any one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
particulars as well as to the general <i>class</i>. For
instance, one may have a <i>particular idea</i> of
some <i>particular</i> horse, which applies only to
that particular horse. He may also have a
General Idea of <i>horse</i>, in the generic or <i>class</i>
sense, which idea applies not only to the general
class of <i>horse</i> but also to each and every
<i>horse</i> which is included in that class. <i>The expression
of Generalization or Conception is
called a Concept.</i></p>

<p>III. <i>Judgment</i>, by which is meant the process
of comparing two objects, persons or
things, one with another, and thus perceiving
their agreement or disagreement. Thus we
may compare the two concepts <i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i>,
and perceiving a certain agreement between
them we form the judgment that: "A
<i>horse</i> is an <i>animal</i>;" or comparing <i>horse</i> and
<i>cow</i>, and perceiving their disagreement, we
form the judgment: "A <i>horse</i> is not a <i>cow</i>."
<i>The expression of a judgment is called a
Proposition.</i></p>

<p>IV. <i>Reasoning</i>, by which is meant the
process of comparing two objects, persons or
things, through their relation to a third object,
person or thing. Thus we may reason (a)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
that all mammals are animals; (b) that a
horse is a mammal; (c) that, <i>therefore</i>, a
horse is an animal; the result of the reasoning
being the statement that: "A horse is an
animal." The most fundamental principle of
reasoning, therefore, consists in the comparing
of two objects of thought through and by
means of their relation to a third object. <i>The
natural form of expression of this process of
Reasoning is called a Syllogism.</i></p>

<p>It will be seen that these four processes of
reasoning necessitate the employment of the
processes of Analysis and Synthesis, respectively.
Analysis means a separating of an
object of thought into its constituent parts,
qualities or relations. Synthesis means the
combining of the qualities, parts or relations
of an object of thought into a composite whole.
These two processes are found in all processes
of Reasoning. Abstraction is principally
analytic; Generalization or Conception chiefly
synthetic; Judgment is either or both analytic
or synthetic; Reasoning is either a synthesis
of particulars in Induction, or an evolution
of the particular from the general in Deduction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two great classes of Reasoning;
<i>viz.</i>, (1) Inductive Reasoning, or the inference
of general truths from particular truths;
and (2) Deductive Reasoning, or the inference
of particular truths from general truths.</p>

<p><i>Inductive Reasoning</i> proceeds by discovering
a general truth from particular truths.
For instance, from the particular truths that
individual men die we discover the general
truth that "All men must die;" or from observing
that in all observed instances ice
melts at a certain temperature, we may infer
that "All ice melts at a certain temperature."
Inductive Reasoning proceeds from the
<i>known to the unknown</i>. It is essentially a
synthetic process. It seeks to discover general
laws from particular facts.</p>

<p><i>Deductive Reasoning</i> proceeds by discovering
particular truths from general truths.
Thus we reason that as all men die, John
Smith, being a man, must die; or, that as all
ice melts at a certain temperature, it follows
that the particular piece of ice under consideration
will melt at that certain temperature.
Deductive Reasoning is therefore seen to be
essentially an analytical process.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mills says of Inductive Reasoning: "The
inductive method of the ancients consisted in
ascribing the character of general truths to all
propositions which are true in all the instances
of which we have knowledge. Bacon exposed
the insufficiency of this method, and physical
investigation has now far outgrown the Baconian
conception.... Induction, then,
is that operation by which we infer that what
we know to be true in a particular case or
cases, will be true in all cases which resemble
the former in certain assignable respects. In
other words, induction is the process by which
we conclude that what is true of certain individuals
of a class is true of the whole class,
or that what is true at certain times will be
true in similar circumstances at all times."</p>

<p>Regarding Deductive Reasoning, a writer
says: "Deductive Reasoning is that process
of reasoning by which we arrive at the necessary
consequences, <i>starting from admitted or
established premises</i>." Brooks says: "The
general truths from which we reason to particulars
are derived from several distinct
sources. Some are intuitive, as the axioms
of mathematics or logic. Some of them are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
derived from induction.... Some of
them are merely hypothetical, as in the investigation
of the physical sciences. Many of
the hypotheses and theories of the physical
sciences are used as general truth for deductive
reasoning; as the theory of gravitation,
the theory of light; etc. Reasoning from
the theory of universal gravitation, Leverrier
discovered the position of a new planet in the
heavens before it had been discovered by
human eyes."</p>

<p>Halleck points out the interdependence of
Inductive and Deductive Reasoning in the
following words: "Man has to find out
through his own experience, or that of others,
the <i>major premises</i> from which he argues or
draws his conclusions. By induction we examine
what seems to us a sufficient number of
individual cases. We then conclude that the
rest of these cases, which we have not examined,
<i>will obey the same general laws</i>....
The premise, 'All cows chew the cud,' was laid
down after a certain number of cows had been
examined. If we were to see a cow twenty
years hence, we should expect that she chewed
her cud.... After Induction has classi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>fied
certain phenomena and <i>thus given us a
major premise</i>, we proceed deductively to apply
the inference to any new specimen that
can be shown to belong to that class."</p>

<p>The several steps of Deductive Reasoning
shall now be considered in turn as we proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE CONCEPT</small></h2>


<p>In considering the process of thinking, we
must classify the several steps or stages of
thought that we may examine each in detail
for the purpose of comprehending them combined
as a whole. In actual thinking these
several steps or stages are not clearly separated
in consciousness, so that each stands
out clear and distinct from the preceding and
succeeding steps or stages, but, on the contrary,
they blend and shade into each other
so that it is often difficult to draw a clear dividing
line. The first step or stage in the
process of thinking is that which is called
<i>a concept</i>.</p>

<p>A concept is a mental representation of
anything. Prof. Wm. James says: "The
function by which we mark off, discriminate,
draw a line around, and identify a numerically
distinct subject of discourse is called <i>conception</i>."
There are five stages or steps in each
concept, as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <i>Presentation.</i> Before a concept may be
formed there must first be a presentation of
the material from which the concept is to be
formed. If we wish to form the concept,
<i>animal</i>, we must first have perceived an animal,
probably several kinds of animals&mdash;horses,
dogs, cats, cows, pigs, lions, tigers,
etc. We must also have received impressions
from the sight of these animals which may be
reproduced by the memory&mdash;represented to
the mind. In order that we may have a full
concept of <i>animal</i> we should have perceived
every kind of animal, for otherwise there
would be some elements of the full concept
lacking. Accordingly it is practically impossible
to have a <i>full</i> concept of anything. The
greater the opportunities for perception the
greater will be the opportunity for conception.
In other books of this series we have
spoken of the value and importance of the attention
and of clear and full perception. Without
an active employment of the attention, it
is impossible to receive a clear perception of
anything; and unless the perception has been
clear, it is impossible for the mind to form a
clear concept of the thing perceived. As Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Wm. Hamilton has said: "An act of attention,
that is an act of concentration, seems
thus necessary to every exertion of consciousness,
as a certain contraction of the pupil is
requisite to every exertion of vision....
Attention, then, is to consciousness what the
contraction of the pupil is to sight, or to the
eye of the mind what the microscope or telescope
is to the bodily eye.... It constitutes
the half of all intellectual power." And
Sir B. Brodie said: "It is attention, much
more than in the abstract power of reasoning,
which constitutes the vast difference which
exists between minds of different individuals."
And as Dr. Beattie says: "The force
with which anything strikes the mind is generally
in proportion to the degree of attention
bestowed upon it."</p>

<p>II. <i>Comparison.</i> Following the stage of
Presentation is the stage of Comparison. We
separate our general concept of <i>animal</i> into
a number of sub-concepts, or concepts of various
kinds of animals. We compare the pig
with the goat, the cow with the horse, in fact
each animal with all other animals known to
us. By this process we distinguish the points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of resemblance and the points of difference.
We perceive that the wolf resembles the dog
to a considerable degree; that it has some
points of resemblance to the fox; and a still
less distinct resemblance to the bear; also
that it differs materially from the horse, the
cow or the elephant. We also learn that there
are various kinds of wolves, all bearing a
great resemblance to each other, and yet having
marked points of difference. The closer
we observe the various individuals among the
wolves, the more points of difference do we
find. The faculty of Comparison evidences
itself in inductive reasoning; ability and disposition
to analyze, classify, compare, etc.
Fowler says that those in whom it is largely
developed "Reason clearly and correctly from
conclusions and scientific facts up to the laws
which govern them; discern the known from
the unknown; detect error by its incongruity
with facts; have an excellent talent for comparing,
explaining, expounding, criticising,
exposing, etc." Prof. William James says:
"Any personal or practical interest in the
results to be obtained by distinguishing,
makes one's wits amazingly sharp to detect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
differences. And long training and practice
in distinguishing has the same effect as personal
interest. Both of these agencies give
to small amounts of objective difference the
same effectiveness upon the mind that, under
other circumstances, only large ones would
make."</p>

<p>III. <i>Abstraction.</i> Following the stage of
Comparison is that of Abstraction. The term
"Abstraction" as used in psychology means:
"The act or process of separating from the
numerous qualities inherent in any object, the
particular one which we wish to make the subject
of observation and reflection. Or, the act
of withdrawing the consciousness from a number
of objects with a view to concentrate it on
some particular one. The negative act of
which Attention is the positive." To <i>abstract</i>
is "to separate or set apart." In the process
of Abstraction in our consideration of <i>animals</i>,
after having recognized the various
points of difference and resemblance between
the various species and individuals, we proceed
to consider some special quality of animals,
and, in doing so, we <i>abstract</i>, set aside,
or separate the particular quality which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
wish to consider. If we wish to consider the
<i>size</i> of animals, we abstract the quality of
size from the other qualities, and consider
animals with reference to size alone. Thus
we consider the various degrees of size of the
various animals, classifying them accordingly.
In the same way we may abstract the
quality of shape, color or habits, respectively,
setting aside this quality for special observation
and classification. If we wish to study,
examine or consider certain qualities in a thing
we abstract that particular quality from the
other qualities of the thing; or we abstract
the other qualities until nothing is left but the
particular quality under consideration. In
examining or considering a class or number
of things, we first abstract the qualities
<i>possessed in common</i> by the class or number
of things; and also abstract or set aside the
qualities <i>not common</i> to them.</p>

<p>For instance; in considering classes of animals,
we abstract the combined quality of
milk-giving and pouch-possessing which is
possessed in common by a number of animals;
then we group these several animals in a class
which we name the <i>Marsupialia</i>, of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
opossum and kangaroo are members. In
these animals the young are brought forth in
an imperfect condition, undeveloped in size
and condition, and are then kept in the pouch
and nourished until they are able to care for
themselves. Likewise, we may abstract the
idea of the <i>placenta</i>, the appendage which
connects the young unborn animal with the
mother, and by means of which the f&oelig;tus is
nourished. The animals distinguished by this
quality are grouped together as the Placental
Mammals. The Placental Mammals are divided
into various groups, by an Abstraction
of qualities or class resemblance or difference,
as follows: The <i>Edentata</i>, or toothless
creatures, such as the sloths, ant-eaters, armadillos,
etc.; the <i>Sirenia</i>, so-named from their
fancied resemblance to the fabled "sirens,"
among which class are the sea-cows, manatees,
dugongs, etc.; the <i>Cetacea</i>, or whale family,
which although fish-like in appearance, are
really mammals, giving birth to living young
which they nourish with breast-milk, among
which are the whales, porpoises, dolphins,
etc.; the <i>Ungulata</i>, or hoofed animals, such
as the horse, the tapir, the rhinoceros, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
swine, the hippopotamus, the camel, the deer,
the sheep, the cow, etc.; the <i>Hyracoidea</i>, having
teeth resembling both the hoofed animals
and the gnawing animals, of which the coney
or rock-rabbit is the principal example; the
<i>Proboscidea</i>, or trunked animals, which family
is represented by the various families of
elephants; the <i>Carnivora</i>, or flesh-eaters,
represented by various sub-families and
species; the <i>Rodentia</i>, or gnawers; the <i>Insectivora</i>,
or insect feeders; the <i>Cheiroptera</i>, or
finger-winged; the <i>Lemuroidea</i>, or lemurs,
having the general appearance of the monkey,
but also the long bushy tail of the fox; the
<i>Primates</i>, including the monkeys, baboons,
man-apes, gibbons, gorillas, chimpanzees,
orang-outangs and Man.</p>

<p>In all of these cases you will see that each
class or general family possesses a certain
<i>common quality</i> which gives it its classification,
and which quality is the subject of the
Abstraction in considering the particular
group of animals. Further and closer Abstraction
divides these classes into sub-classes;
for instance, the family or class of
the <i>Carnivora</i>, or flesh-eaters, may be di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>vided
by further Abstraction into the classes
of seals, bears, weasels, wolves, dogs, lions,
tigers, leopards, etc. In this process, we must
first make the more general Abstraction of
the wolf and similar animals into the dog-family;
and the lion, tiger and similar forms
into the cat-family.</p>

<p>Halleck says of Abstraction: "In the process
of Abstraction, we draw our attention
away from a mass of confusing details, unimportant
at the time, and attend only to qualities
common to the class. Abstraction is little
else than centering the power of attention on
some qualities to the exclusion of others."</p>

<p>IV. <i>Generalization.</i> Arising from the
stage of Abstraction is the stage of Generalization.
<i>Generalization</i> is: "The act or process
of generalizing or making general; bringing
several objects agreeing in some point
under a common or general name, head or
class; an extending from particulars to generals;
reducing or arranging in a genus;
bringing a particular fact or series of facts
into a relation with a wider circle of facts."
As Bolingbroke says: "The mind, therefore,
makes its utmost endeavors to <i>generalize</i> its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
ideas, beginning early with such as are most
familiar and coming in time to those which are
less so." Under the head of Abstraction we
have seen that through Abstraction we may
Generalize the various species into the various
families, and thus, in turn, into the various
sub-families. Following the same process
we may narrow down the sub-families into
species composed of various individuals; or
into greater and still greater families or
groups. Generalization is really the act of
Classification, or forming into classes all
things having certain qualities or properties
<i>in common</i>. The corollary is that <i>all things
in a certain generalized class must possess the
particular quality or property common to the
class</i>. Thus we know that all animals in the
class of the <i>Carnivora</i> must eat flesh; and that
all <i>Mammals</i> possess breasts from which they
feed their young. As Halleck says: "We
put all objects having like qualities into a certain
<i>genus</i>, or class. When the objects are in
that class, <i>we know that certain qualities will
have a general application to them all</i>."</p>

<p>V. <i>Denomination.</i> Following closely upon
the step of Generalization or Classification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
is the step of Denomination. By <i>Denomination</i>
we mean "the act of naming or designating
by a name." A name is the symbol by
which we think of a familiar thing without the
necessity for making a distinct mental image
upon each occasion of thought. Or, it may be
considered as akin to a <i>label</i> affixed to a thing.
As in the case of the algebraic symbols, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>x</i>, and <i>y</i>, by the use of which we are able to
make intricate calculations easily and rapidly,
so may we use these word symbols much more
readily than we could the lengthy descriptions
or even the mental images of the thing symbolized.
It is much easier for us to think
"<i>horse</i>" than it would be to think the full
definition of that animal, or to think of it by
recalling a mental picture of the horse each
time we wished to think of it. Or, it is much
better for us to be able to glance at a label on
a package or bottle than to examine the contents
in detail. As Hobbes says: "A word
taken at pleasure to serve for a mark, which
may raise in our minds a thought like to some
thought we had before, and which being pronounced
to others, may be to them a sign of
what thought the speaker had or had not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
before in his mind." Mill says: "A name
is a word (or set of words) serving the
double purpose of a mark to recall to ourselves
the likeness of a former thought and as
a sign to make it known to others." Some
philosophers regard names as symbols of <i>our
ideas of things</i>, rather than of the things
themselves; others regard them as symbols
of the things themselves. It will be seen that
the value of a name depends materially upon
the correct meaning and understanding regarding
it possessed by the person using it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE USE OF CONCEPTS</small></h2>


<p>Having observed the several steps or stages
of a concept, let us now consider the use and
misuse of the latter. At first glance it would
appear difficult to misuse a concept, but a little
consideration will show that people very commonly
fall into error regarding their concepts.</p>

<p>For instance, a child perceives a horse, a
cow or a sheep and hears its elders apply the
term "<i>animal</i>" to it. This term is perfectly
correct, although symbolizing only a very general
classification or generalization. But, the
child knowing nothing of the more limited and
detailed classification begins to generalize regarding
the animal. To it, accordingly, an
"animal" is identical with the dog or the cow,
the sheep or the horse, as the case may be, and
when the term is used the child thinks that
<i>all animals</i> are similar to the particular animal
seen. Later on, when it hears the term
"animal" applied to a totally different looking
creature, it thinks that a mistake has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
made and a state of confusion occurs. Or,
even when a term is applied within narrower
limits, the same trouble occurs. The child
may hear the term "dog" applied to a mastiff,
and it accordingly forms a concept of <i>dog</i>
identical with the qualities and attributes of
the mastiff. Later, hearing the same term
applied to a toy-terrier, it becomes indignant
and cries out that the latter is no "dog" but
is something entirely different. It is not until
the child becomes acquainted with the fact
that there are many kinds of creatures in the
general category of "dog" that the latter
term becomes fully understood and its appropriate
concept is intelligently formed.
Thus we see the importance of the step of Presentation.</p>

<p>In the same way the child might imagine
that because some particular "man" had red
hair and long whiskers, <i>all men</i> were red-haired
and long-whiskered. Such a child
would always form the concept of "man" as a
creature possessed of the personal qualities
just mentioned. As a writer once said, readers
of current French literature might imagine
that all Englishmen were short, dumpy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
red-cheeked and irascible, and that all Englishwomen
had great teeth and enormous feet;
also that readers of English literature might
imagine that all Frenchmen were like monkeys,
and all Frenchwomen were sad coquettes.
In the same way many American
young people believe that all Englishmen say
"Don't you know" and all Englishwomen
constantly ejaculate: "Fancy!" Also that
every Englishman wears a monocle. In the
same way, the young English person, from
reading the cheap novels of his own country,
might well form the concept of all Americans
as long-legged, chin-whiskered and big-nosed,
saying "Waal, I want to know;" "I reckon;"
and "Du tell;" while they tilted themselves
back in a chair with their feet on the mantelpiece.
The concept of a Western man, entertained
by the average Eastern person who has
never traveled further West than Buffalo, is
equally amusing. In the same way, we have
known Western people who formed a concept
of Boston people as partaking of a steady and
continuous diet of baked beans and studiously
reading Browning and Emerson between
these meals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Halleck says: "A certain Norwegian child
ten years old had the quality <i>white</i> firmly imbedded
in his concept <i>man</i>. Happening one
day to see a negro for the first time, the child
refused to call him a man until the negro's
other qualities compelled the child to revise
his concept and to eliminate whiteness. If
that child should ever see an Indian or a
Chinaman, the concept would undergo still
further revision. A girl of six, reared with
an intemperate father and brothers, had the
quality of <i>drunkenness</i> firmly fixed in her concept
of <i>man</i>. A certain boy kept, until the
age of eleven, <i>trustworthiness</i> in his concept
of man. Another boy, until late in his teens
thought that man was a creature who did
wrong not from determination but from ignorance,
that any man would change his course
to the right path if he could but understand
that he was going wrong. Happening one
day to hear of a wealthy man who was neglecting
to provide comforts for his aged mother
in her last sickness, the boy concluded that
the man did not know his mother's condition.
When he informed the man, the boy was told
to mind his own business. The same day he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
heard of some politicians who had intentionally
cheated the city in letting a contract and
he immediately revised his concept. It must
be borne in mind that most of our concepts
are subject to change during our entire life;
that at first they are made only in a tentative
way; that experience may show us, at any
time, that they have been erroneously formed,
that we have, abstracted too little or too much,
made this class too wide or too narrow, or that
here a quality must be added or there one
taken away."</p>

<p>Let us now consider the mental processes
involved in the formation and use of a concept.
We have first, as we have seen, the
presentation of the crude material from which
the concept must be formed. Our attention
being attracted to or directed toward an object,
we notice its qualities and properties.
Then we begin a process of comparison of the
object perceived or of our perception of it.
We compare the object with other objects or
ideas in our mind, noting similarities and differences
and thereby leading towards classification
with similar objects and opposed dissimilar
ones. The greater the range of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
objects previously perceived, the greater will
be the number of relations established between
the new object or idea and others. As we advance
in experience and knowledge, the web
of related objects and ideas becomes more
intricate and complex. The relations attaching
to the child's concept of horse is very
much simpler than the concept of the experienced
adult. Then we pass on to the step of
analysis, in which we separate the qualities of
the object and consider them in detail. The
act of abstraction is an analytical process.
Then we pass on to the step of synthesis, in
which we unite the materials gathered by
comparison and analysis, and thus form a
general idea or concept regarding the object.
In this process we combine the various qualities
discerned by comparison and analysis,
and grouping them together as in a bundle, we
tie them together with the string of synthesis
and thus have a true general conception. Thus
from the first general conception of <i>horse</i> as
a simple thing, we notice first that the animal
has certain qualities lacking in other things
and certain others similar to other things;
then we analyze the various qualities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
horse, recognized through comparison, until
we have a clear and distinct idea of the various
parts, qualities and properties of the
horse; then we synthesize, and joining together
these various conceptions of the said
qualities, we at last form a clear general concept
of <i>the horse as he is</i>, with all his qualities.
Of course, if we later discover other qualities
attached to the horse, we add these to our general
synthesized concept&mdash;our concept of
<i>horse</i> is enlarged.</p>

<p>Of course these various steps in the formation
and use of a concept are not realized as
distinct acts in the consciousness, for the processes
are largely instinctive and subconscious,
particularly in the case of the experienced
individual. The subconscious, or
habit mind, usually attends to these details
for us, except in instances in which we deliberately
apply the will to the task, as in cases of
close study, in which we take the process from
the region of the involuntary and place it in
the voluntary category. So closely related
and blended are these various steps of the
process, that some authorities have disputed
vigorously upon the question as to which of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the two steps, comparison or analysis, precedes
the other. Some have claimed that analysis
must precede comparison, else how
could one compare without having first analyzed
the things to be compared. Others
hold that comparison must precede analysis,
else how could one note a quality unless he
had his attention drawn to it by its resemblance
to or difference from qualities in other
objects. The truth seems to lie between the
two ideas, for in some cases there seems to
be a perception of some similarity or difference
before any analysis or abstraction takes
place; while in others there seems to be an
analysis or abstraction before comparison is
possible. In this book we have followed the
arrangement favored by the latest authorities,
but the question is still an open one to
many minds.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the general concept once
having been formed, the mind proceeds to
classify the concept with others having general
qualities in common. And, likewise, it
proceeds to generalize from the classification,
assuming certain qualities in certain classes.
Then we proceed to make still further general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>izations
and classifications on an ascending
and widening scale, including seeming resemblances
less marked, until finally we embrace
the object with other objects in as large a
class as possible as well as in as close and
limited a sub-class as possible. As Brooks
says: "Generalization is an ascending process.
The broader concept is regarded as
higher than the narrower concept; a concept
is considered higher than a percept; a general
idea stands above a particular idea. We thus
go up from particulars to generals; from percepts
to concepts; from lower concepts to
higher concepts. Beginning down with particular
objects, we rise from them to the general
idea of their class. Having formed a
number of lower classes, we compare them as
we did individuals and generalize them into
higher classes. We perform the same process
with these higher classes, and thus proceed
until we are at last arrested in the highest
class, <i>Being</i>. Having reached the pinnacle
of generalization, we may descend the
ladder by reversing the process through which
we ascend."</p>

<p>From this process of generalization, or syn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>thesis,
we create from our simple concepts
our <i>general concepts</i>. Some of the older authorities
distinguished between these two
classes by terming the former "conceptions,"
and reserving the term "concepts" for the
general concepts. Brooks says of this: "The
products of generalization are general ideas
called <i>concepts</i>. We have already discussed
the method of forming conceptions and now
consider the nature of the concept itself....
A concept is a general idea. It is a
general notion which has in it all that is common
to its own class. It is a general scheme
which embraces all the individuals of the
class while it resembles in all respects none
of its class. Thus my conception of a <i>quadruped</i>
has in it all four-footed animals, but it
does not correspond in all respects to any particular
animals; my conception of a <i>triangle</i>
embraces all triangles, but does not agree in
details with any particular triangle. The
general conception cannot be made to fit exactly
any particular object, but it teems with
many particulars. These points may be illustrated
with the concepts <i>horse</i>, <i>bird</i>, <i>color</i>,
<i>animal</i>, etc."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>So we may begin to perceive the distinction
and difference between a <i>concept</i> and a <i>mental
image</i>. This distinction, and the fact that <i>a
concept cannot be imaged</i>, is generally difficult
for the beginner. It is important that
one should have a clear and distinct understanding
regarding this point, and so we shall
consider it further in the following chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>CONCEPTS AND IMAGES</small></h2>


<p>As we have said, a concept cannot be imaged&mdash;cannot
be used as the subject of a
mental image. This statement is perplexing
to the student who has been accustomed to the
idea that every conception of the mind is capable
of being reproduced in the form of a mental
image. But the apparently paradoxical
statement is seen as quite simple when a little
consideration is given to it.</p>

<p>For instance, you have a distinct general
concept of <i>animal</i>. You know what you mean
when you say or think, <i>animal</i>. You recognize
an animal when you see one and you understand
what is meant when another uses
the word in conversation. But you cannot
form a mental image of the concept, <i>animal</i>.
Why? Because any mental image you might
form would be either a picture of <i>some particular
animal</i> or else a composite of the qualities
of several animals. Your concept is too
broad and general to allow of a composite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
picture of <i>all animals</i>. And, in truth, your
concept is <i>not a picture of anything that actually
exists</i> in one particular, but an abstract
idea embracing the qualities of all animals.
It is like the algebraic <i>x</i>&mdash;a symbol for something
that exists, but not the thing itself.</p>

<p>As Brooks says: "A concept cannot be represented
by a concrete image. This is evident
from its being general rather than particular.
If its color, size or shape is fixed by an
image, it is no longer general but particular."
And Halleck says: "It is impossible to image
anything without giving that image individual
marks. The best mental images are so definite
that a picture could be painted from them.
A being might come under the class <i>man</i> and
have a snub nose, blonde hair, scanty eyebrows,
and no scar on his face. The presence
of one of these individual peculiarities in the
concept <i>man</i> would destroy it. If we form
an image of an apple, it must be either of a
yellow, red, green, or russet apple, either as
large as a pippin or as small as a crab-apple.
A boy was asked what he thought of when
'<i>apple</i>' was mentioned. He replied that he
thought of 'a big, dark-red, apple with a bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
spot on one side, near the top.' That boy
could image distinctly, but his power of forming
concepts was still in its infancy."</p>

<p>So we see that while a mental image must
picture the particular and individual qualities,
properties and appearances of some particular
unit of a class, a <i>concept</i> can and must
contain only the <i>class qualities</i>&mdash;that is, the
qualities belonging to the entire class. The
general concept is as has been said "a general
idea ... a general notion which has in
it all that is common to its own class." And
it follows that a "general idea" of this kind
cannot be pictured. A picture must be of
some particular thing, while a concept is
something above and higher than particular
things. We may picture <i>a man</i>, but we cannot
picture Man the concept of the race. A concept
is not a reproduction of the image of a
<i>thing</i>, but on the contrary is <i>an idea of a class
of things</i>. We trust that the student will consider
this point until he arrives at a clear understanding
of the distinction, and the reason
thereof.</p>

<p>But, while a concept is incapable of being
pictured mentally as an image, it is true that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
<i>some particular representative of a class</i> may
be held in the mind or imagination as <i>an idealized
object</i>, as a general representative of the
class, when we speak or think of the general
term or concept, providing that its real relation
to the concept is recognized. These idealized
objects, however, are not concepts&mdash;they
are <i>percepts</i> reproduced by the memory. It is
important, however, to all who wish to convey
their thought plainly, that they be able to
convert their concepts into idealized representative
objects. Otherwise, they tend to become
too idealistic and abstract for common
comprehension. As Halleck well says: "We
should in all cases be ready to translate our
concepts, when occasion requires, into the
images of those individuals which the concept
represents. A concept means nothing except
in reference to certain individuals. Without
them it could never have had existence and
they are entitled to representation. A man
who cannot translate his concepts into definite
images of the proper objects, is fitted
neither to teach, preach, nor practice any profession....
There was, not long ago, a
man very fond of talking about <i>fruit</i> in the ab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>stract;
but he failed to recognize an individual
cranberry when it was placed before him. A
humorist remarked that a certain metaphysician
had such a love for abstractions, and such
an intense dislike for concrete things, as to
refuse to eat a concrete peach when placed before
him."</p>

<p>In the beginning many students are perplexed
regarding the difference between a
<i>percept</i> and a <i>concept</i>. The distinction is simple
when properly considered. A percept is:
"the object of an act of perception; that which
is perceived." A concept is: "a mental representation."
Brooks makes the following
distinction: "A <i>percept</i> is the mental product
of a real thing; a <i>concept</i> is a mere idea or notion
of the common attributes of things. A
<i>percept</i> represents some particular object; a
<i>concept</i> is not particular, but general. A <i>percept</i>
can be described by particulars; a <i>concept</i>
can be described only by generals. The
former can usually be represented by an image,
the latter cannot be imagined, <i>it can only
be thought</i>." Thus one is able to image the
<i>percept</i> of a particular horse which has been
perceived; but he is unable to image correctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the concept of <i>horse</i> as a class or generic term.</p>

<p>In connection with this distinction between
<i>perception</i> and <i>conception</i>, we may as well
consider the subject of <i>apperception</i>, a term
favored by many modern psychologists, although
others steadfastly decline to recognize
its necessity or meaning and refuse to employ
it. Apperception may be defined as: "perception
accompanied by comprehension; perception
accompanied by recognition." The
thing perceived is held to be comprehended or
recognized&mdash;that is, <i>perceived in a new sense</i>,
by reason of certain previously acquired ideas
in the mind. Halleck explains it as: "the
perception of things in relation to the ideas
which we already possess." It follows that
all individuals possessed of equally active organs
of perception, and equally active attention,
will perceive the same thing in the same
way and in the same degree. But the <i>apperception</i>
of each individual will differ and vary
according to his previous experience and
training, temperament and taste, habit and
custom. For instance, the familiar story of the
boy who climbed a tree and watched the
passers-by, noting their comments. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
passer-by noticing the tree, says aloud: "That
would make a good stick of timber." "Good
morning, Mr. Carpenter," said the boy. The
next man said: "That tree has fine bark."
"Good morning, Mr. Tanner," said the boy.
Another said, "I bet there's a squirrel's nest
up in that tree." "Good morning, Mr.
Hunter," said the boy.</p>

<p>The woman sees in a bird something pretty
and "cunning." The hunter sees in it something
to kill. The ornithologist sees it as
something of a certain genus and species, and
perhaps also as something appropriate for his
collection. The farmer perceives it to be
something destructive of either insects or
crops. A thief sees a jail as something to be
dreaded; an ordinary citizen, something useful
for confining objectionable people; a policeman,
something in the line of his business.
And so on, the apperception differing
upon the previous experience of the individual.
In the same way the scientist sees in
an animal or rock many qualities of which the
ordinary person is ignorant. Our training,
experience, prejudices, etc., affect our apperception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>And so, we see that in a measure our <i>concepts</i>
are determined not only by our simple
perceptions, but also materially by our apperceptions.
We conceive things not only as they
are apparent to our senses, but also as colored
and influenced by our previous impressions
and ideas. For this reason we find widely
varying concepts of the same things among
different individuals. Only an absolute mind
could form an absolute concept.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<small>TERMS</small></h2>


<p>In logic the words <i>concept</i> and <i>term</i> are
practically identical, but in the popular usage
of the terms there is a distinct difference. This
difference is warranted, if we depart from the
theoretical phase of logic, for the word <i>concept</i>
really denotes an <i>idea</i> in the mind, while
the word <i>term</i> really denotes a <i>word</i> or name
of an idea or concept&mdash;the symbol of the latter.
In a previous chapter we have seen that Denomination,
or "the act of naming or designating
by a name" is the final step or stage in
forming a concept. And it is a fact that the
majority of the words in the languages of
civilized people denote general ideas or concepts.
As Brooks says: "To give each individual
or particular idea a name peculiar to itself
would be impracticable and indeed impossible;
the mind would soon become overwhelmed
with its burden of names. Nearly all
the ordinary words of our language are general
rather than particular. The individuals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
distinguished by particular names, excepting
persons and places, are comparatively few.
Most objects are named only by common
nouns; nearly all of our verbs express general
actions; our adjectives denote common qualities,
and our adverbs designate classes of actions
and qualities. There are very few words
in the language, besides the names of persons
and places, that do not express general ideas."</p>

<p>In logic the word <i>term</i> is employed to denote
<i>any word or words which constitute a concept</i>.
The word <i>concept</i> is employed strictly in the
sense of <i>a subject of thought</i>, without reference
to the words symbolizing it. The <i>concept</i>,
or subject of thought, is the important
element or fact and the <i>term</i> denoting it is
merely a convenient symbol of expression. It
must be remembered that a <i>term</i> does not
necessarily consists of but a single word, for
often many words are employed to denote the
concept, sometimes even an entire clause or
phrase being found necessary for the current
<i>term</i>. For the purpose of the consideration
of the subjects to be treated upon in this book,
we may agree that: <i>A term is the outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
symbol of a concept</i>; and that: <i>The concept
is the idea expressed by the term</i>.</p>

<p>There are three general parts or phases of
Deductive Logic, namely: Terms, Propositions
and Syllogisms. Therefore, in considering
Terms we are entering into a consideration
of the first phase of Deductive Logic. Unless
we have a correct understanding of
Terms, we cannot expect to understand the
succeeding stages of Deductive Reasoning.
As Jevons says: "When we join terms together
we make a Proposition; when we join
Propositions together, we make an argument
or piece of reasoning.... We should
generally get nothing but nonsense if we were
to put together any terms and any propositions
and to suppose that we were reasoning.
To produce a good argument we must be careful
to obey certain rules, which it is the purpose
of Logic to make known. But, in order to
understand the matter perfectly, <i>we ought
first to learn exactly what a term is, and how
many kinds of terms there may be</i>; we have
next to learn the nature of a proposition and
the different kinds of propositions. Afterwards
we shall learn how one proposition may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by reasoning be drawn from other propositions
in the kind of argument called the
syllogism."</p>

<p>Now, having seen that terms are the outward
symbols or expression of concepts, and
are the names of things which we join together
in a proposition, let us proceed to consider
the different kinds of terms, following
the classifications adopted by the authorities.</p>

<p>A <i>term</i> may contain any number of nouns,
substantive or adjective or it may contain but
a single noun. Thus in, "Tigers are ferocious,"
the first term is the single substantive
"tigers;" the second term is the single adjective
"ferocious." And in the proposition,
"The King of England is the Emperor of
India," there are two terms, each composed
of two nouns, "King of England" being the
first term and "Emperor of India" being the
second term. The proposition, "The library
of the British Museum is the greatest collection
of books in the world," contains fifteen
words but <i>only two terms</i>; the first term being
"The library of the British Museum," in
which are two substantives, one adjective, two
definite articles and one preposition; the sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ond
term being, "the greatest collection of
books in the world," which contains three substantives,
one adjective, two articles, and two
prepositions. The above illustration is supplied
by Jevons, who adds: "A logical term,
then, may consist of any number of nouns,
substantive or adjective, with the articles,
prepositions and conjunctions required to join
them together; still <i>it is only one term if it
points out, or makes us think of a single object,
or collection, or class of objects</i>." (A
substantive, is: "the part of speech which expresses
something that exists, either material
or immaterial.")</p>

<p>The first classification of terms divides
them into two general classes, <i>viz.</i>, (1) Singular
Terms; and (2) General Terms.</p>

<p>A <i>Singular Term</i> is a term denoting a single
object, person or thing. Although denoting
only a single object, person or thing, it may
be composed of several words; or it may be
composed of but one word as in the case of a
proper name, etc. The following are Singular
Terms, because they are terms denoting but a
single object, person or thing: "Europe; Minnesota;
Socrates; Shakespeare; the first man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the highest good; the first cause; the King of
England; the British Museum; the Commissioner
of Public Works; the main street of the
City of New York." It will be noted that in
all of the examples given, the Singular Term
denotes a particular something, a specific
thing, a something of which there is but one,
and that one possesses particularity and individuality.
As Hyslop says: "<i>Oneness of kind</i>
is not the only or distinctive feature of Singular
Terms, but <i>individuality</i>, or singularity, as
representing a concrete individual whole."</p>

<p>A <i>General Term</i> is a term which applies, in
the same sense, to each and every individual
object, person or thing in a number of objects,
persons or things of the same kind, or to the
entire class composed of such objects persons
or things of the same kind. For instance,
"horse; man; biped; mammal; trees; figures;
grain of sand; matter," etc. Hyslop says, regarding
General Terms: "In these instances
the terms denote more than one object, and
apply to all of the same kind. Their meaning
is important in the interpretation of what are
called universal propositions."</p>

<p>Another general classification of Terms di<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>vides
them into two respective classes, as follows:
(1) Collective Terms; and (2) Distributive
Terms. Hyslop says of this classification:
"This division is based upon the distinction
between aggregate wholes of the same
kind and class terms. It partly coincides with
the division into Singular and General Terms,
the latter always being distributive."</p>

<p>A <i>Collective Term</i> is one which denotes an
aggregate or collected whole of objects, persons
or things of the same or similar kind,
<i>which collective whole is considered as an individual</i>,
although composed of a totality of separate
individual objects, persons or things.
Thus the following terms: "regiment; congregation;
army; family; crowd; nation; company;
battalion; class; congress; parliament;
convention;" etc. are Collective Terms, because
they denote collective, aggregate or
composite wholes, considered as an individual.</p>

<p>A <i>Distributive Term</i> is a term which denotes
<i>each and every individual object, person or
thing in a given class</i>. For example, are the
terms: "man; quadruped; biped; mammal;
book; diamond; tree." As Hyslop says:
"General terms are always distributive."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Also: "It is important also to keep clear the
distinction between <i>class</i> wholes and <i>collective</i>
wholes.... They are often confused so
as to call a term denoting a <i>class</i> a Collective
Term."</p>

<p>Another general classification of Terms
divides them into the following two respective
classes; (1) Concrete Terms; and (2) Abstract
Terms.</p>

<p>A <i>Concrete Term</i> is a term denoting either
a definite object, person or thing which is subject
to perception and experience, and may
be considered as actually existent concretely,
as for instance: horse; man; mountain; dollar;
knife; table; etc., or else an attribute
thought of and used solely as an attribute, as
for instance: "beautiful, wise, noble, virtuous,
good," etc.</p>

<p>An <i>Abstract Term</i> is a term denoting the attribute,
quality or property <i>considered as
apart from the object, person or thing</i> and as
having an abstract existence, as for instance:
"beauty; wisdom; nobility; goodness; virtue,"
etc. As we have seen elsewhere, these
qualities have no real existence <i>in themselves</i>,
but are known and thought of only in connec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>tion
with concrete objects, persons and things.
Thus we cannot know "Beauty," but may
know <i>beautiful things</i>; we cannot know "Virtue,"
but we may know virtuous people, etc.</p>

<p>An <i>attribute or quality</i> is <i>concrete</i> when expressed
as an <i>adjective</i>; and <i>abstract</i> when
expressed as a <i>noun</i>; as for instance, "beautiful"
and "beauty," respectively, or "virtuous"
and "virtue," respectively. The distinction
may be summed up as follows: A Concrete
Term is <i>the name of a thing or of a quality
of a thing expressed as an adjective and as
merely a quality</i>; while an Abstract Term is
the name of a quality of a thing, <i>expressed as
a noun and as a "thing" in itself</i>.</p>

<p>Certain terms may be used as either Concrete
Terms or as Abstract Terms, and certain
authorities have seen fit to classify them
as <i>Mixed Terms</i>, as for instance the terms:
"government; religion; philosophy;" etc.</p>

<p>Another general classification of Terms divides
them into two respective classes as follows:
(1) <i>Positive Terms</i>; and (2) <i>Negative
Terms</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>Positive Term</i> is a term which denotes its
own qualities, as for instance: "good, human,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
large, square, black, strong," etc. These
terms indicate the presence of the quality denoted
by the term itself.</p>

<p>A <i>Negative Term</i> is a term denoting the absence
of a quality, as for instance: "inhuman,
inorganic, unwell, unpleasant, non-conducive,"
etc. These terms <i>deny</i> the presence of
certain qualities, rather than <i>asserting</i> the
presence of an opposite quality. They are essentially
negative in nature and in form.
Jevons says: "We may usually know a Negative
Term by its beginning with one of the
little syllables un-, in-, a-, an-, non-, or by its
ending with -less." Hyslop says: "The usual
symbols of Negative Terms are <i>in</i>, <i>un</i>, <i>less</i>,
<i>dis</i>, <i>a</i>, or <i>an</i>, <i>anti</i>, <i>mis</i>, and sometimes <i>de</i>, and
<i>non</i> and <i>not</i>." Jevons adds: "If the English
language were a perfect one, every term ought
to have a Negative Term exactly corresponding
to it, so that all adjectives and nouns
would be in pairs. Just as <i>convenient</i> has its
negative <i>inconvenient</i>; metallic, non-metallic;
logical, illogical; and so on; so blue should
have its negative, non-blue; literary, non-literary;
paper, non-paper. But many of
these Negative Terms would be seldom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
never used, and if we happen to want them, we
can make them for the occasion by putting
not-, or non-, before the Positive Term. Accordingly,
we find in the dictionary only those
Negative Terms which are much employed."</p>

<p>The last named authority also says:
"Sometimes the same word may seem to have
two or even more distinct negatives. There is
much difference between <i>undressed</i> and <i>not-dressed</i>,
that is 'not in evening dress.' Both
seem to be negatives of 'dressed,' but this is
because the word has two distinct meanings."</p>

<p>Some authorities insist upon closer and further
classification, as for instance, in the case
of what they call a <i>Privative Term</i>, denoting
the absence of qualities once possessed by the
object, person or thing, as: "deaf, dead, blind,
dark," etc. Hyslop says that these terms
"are Positive in form and Negative in matter
or meaning." Also in the case of what they
call a <i>Nego-positive Term</i>, denoting "the
presence of a positive quality expressed in a
negative manner," as: disagreeable, inhuman,
invaluable, etc. These last mentioned classes
however are regarded by some as the result
of "carrying too far" the tendency toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
classification, and the two general classes,
Positive and Negative, are thought sufficient
for the purpose of the general student. The
same objection applies to a classification occasionally
made <i>i.e.</i>, that which is called an
<i>Infinitated Term</i>, denoting a term the intent
of which is to place in a distinct category
every object, person or thing other than that
expressed in the corresponding Positive
Term. The intent of the term is to place the
positive idea in one class, and all else into a
separate one. Examples of this class of terms
are found in: "not-I, not-animal, not-tree, unmoral,"
etc. Hyslop says of these terms:
"They are not always, if ever, recognized as
rhetorically elegant, but are valuable often to
make clear the really negative, or infinitatively
negative nature of the idea in mind."</p>

<p>Another general classification of Terms divides
them into two respective classes, as follows:
(1) Absolute Terms; and (2) Relative
Terms.</p>

<p>An <i>Absolute Term</i> is a term denoting the
presence of qualities intrinsic to the object,
and not depending upon any relation to any
other object, as for instance: "man; book;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
horse; gun;" etc. These terms <i>may be</i> related
to many other terms, but are <i>not necessarily</i>
related to any other.</p>

<p>A <i>Relative Term</i> is a term denoting certain
<i>necessary</i> relations to other terms, as for instance:
"father; son; mother; daughter;
teacher; pupil; master; servant;" etc. Thus
it is impossible to think of "child" except in
relation to "parent," or <i>vice versa</i>. The one
term implies the existence of its related term.</p>

<p>Hyslop says of the above classification:
"Relative Terms suggest the thought of other
individuals with the relation involved as a
part of the term's meaning, while Absolute
Terms suggest only the qualities in the subject
without a relation to others being necessarily
involved."</p>

<p>Some authorities also classify terms as
<i>higher and lower</i>; also as <i>broad and narrow</i>.
This classification is meant to indicate the
content and extent of the term. For instance,
when we classify, we begin with the individuals
which we then group into a small class.
These classes we then group into a larger
class, according to their resemblances. These
larger classes then go to form a part of still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
larger classes, and so on. As these classes
advance they form <i>broader</i> terms; and as we
retreat from the general class into the less
general and more particular, the term becomes
<i>narrower</i>. By some, the <i>broader</i> term which
includes the narrower is called the <i>higher
term</i>, and the narrower are called the <i>lower
terms</i>. Thus <i>animal</i> would be a higher and
broader term than dog, cat or tiger because it
includes the latter. Brooks says: "Since a
concept is formed by the union of the common
attributes of individuals, it thus embraces
both attributes and individuals. The attributes
of a concept constitute what is called its
<i>content</i>; the individuals it embraces constitute
its <i>extent</i>."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the feature of including objects
in a concept or term is called its <i>extension</i>;
while the feature of including attributes
or qualities is called its intension. It follows
as a natural consequence that the greater the
<i>extension</i> of a term, the less its <i>intension</i>; the
greater its <i>intension</i>, the less its <i>extension</i>.
We will understand this more clearly when we
consider that the more individuals contained
in a term, the fewer <i>common</i> properties or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
qualities it can contain; and the more common
properties, the fewer individuals. As Brooks
says: "The concept <i>man</i> has more <i>extension</i>
than <i>poet</i>, <i>orator</i> or <i>statesman</i>, since it embraces
more individuals; and less <i>intension</i>,
since we must lay aside the distinctive attributes
of poet, orator and statesman in order
to unite them in a common class <i>man</i>." In
the same way the general term <i>animal</i> is quite
extended for it includes a large number of individual
varieties of very different and varied
characteristics and qualities; as for instance,
the lion, camel, dog, oyster, elephant, snail,
worm, snake, etc. Accordingly its intension
must be small for it can include only the qualities
common to all animals, which are very
few indeed. The definition of the term shows
how small is its <i>intension</i>, as: "<i>Animal.</i> An
organic being, rising above a vegetable in various
respects, especially in possessing sensibility,
will and the power of voluntary motion."
Another narrows the intension still
further when he defines <i>animal</i> as: "a creature
which possesses, or has possessed, life."
Halleck says: "<i>Animal</i> is very narrow in intension,
very broad in extension. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
few qualities common to all animals, but there
is a vast number of animals. To give the full
meaning of the term in <i>extension</i>, we should
have to name every animal, from the microscopic
infusoria to the tiger, from the angleworm
to the whale. When we decrease the
extension to one species of animal, <i>horse</i>, the
individuals are fewer, the qualities more
numerous."</p>

<p>The importance of forming clear and distinct
concepts and of grouping, classifying
and generalizing these into larger and broader
concepts and terms is recognized by all authorities
and is generally regarded as forming
the real basis of all constructive thought.
As Brooks says: "Generalization lies at the
basis of language: only as man can form general
conceptions is it possible for him to form
a language.... Nearly all the ordinary
words in our language are general rather than
particular.... This power of generalization
lies also at the basis of science. Had
we no power of forming general ideas, each
particular object would be a study by itself,
and we should thus never pass beyond the
very alphabet of knowledge. Judgments, ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>cept
in the simplest form, would be impossible;
and it is difficult to see how even the simplest
form of the syllogism could be constructed.
No general conclusion could be
drawn from particulars, nor particular conclusions
from generals; and thus neither inductive
nor deductive reasoning would be possible.
The classifications of science could not
be made; and knowledge would end at the
very threshold of science."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>THE MEANING OF TERMS</small></h2>


<p>Every term has its <i>meaning</i>, or <i>content</i>, as
some authorities prefer to call it. The word
or words of which the term is composed are
merely vocal sounds, serving as a symbol for
the real <i>meaning</i> of the term, which <i>meaning</i>
exists only in the mind of the person understanding
it. To one not understanding the
meaning of the term, the latter is but as a
meaningless sound, but to one understanding
it the sound awakens mental associations and
representation and thus serves its purpose as
a symbol of thought.</p>

<p>Each concrete general term has two <i>meanings</i>,
(1) the actual concrete thing, person or
object to which the term is applied; and (2)
the qualities, attributes or properties of those
objects, persons or things in consequence of
which the term is applied. For instance, in
the case of the concrete term <i>book</i>, the first
meaning consists of the general idea of the
thing which we think of as <i>a book</i>, and the sec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>ond
meaning consists of the various qualities
which go to make that thing a book, as the
printed pages, the binding, the form, the
cover, etc. Not only is that particular thing
<i>a book</i>, but every other thing having the same
or similar properties also must be <i>a book</i>.
And so, whenever I call a thing <i>a book</i> it must
possess the said qualities. And, whenever I
combine the ideas of these qualities in
thought, I must think of <i>a book</i>. As Jevons
says: "In reality, every ordinary general
term has a double meaning: it means the
things to which it is applied, ... it also
means, in a totally different way, the qualities
and peculiarities <i>implied</i> as being in the
things. Logicians say that the number of
things to which a term applies is the <i>extension</i>
of the term; while the number of qualities or
peculiarities implied is the <i>intension</i>."</p>

<p>The extension and intension of terms has
been referred to in the previous chapter. The
general classification of the degrees of <i>extension</i>
of a general term is expressed by the two
terms, <i>Genus</i> and <i>Species</i>, respectively. The
classification of the character of the <i>intension</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of a term is expressed by the term, <i>Difference</i>,
<i>Property</i> and <i>Accident</i>, respectively.</p>

<p><i>Genus</i> is a term indicating: "a class of objects
containing several species; a class more
extensive than a species; a universal which is
predicable of several things of different
species."</p>

<p><i>Species</i> is a term denoting: "a smaller class
of objects than a genus, and of two or more
of which a genus is composed; a predicable
that expresses the whole essence of its subject
in so far as any common term can express
it."</p>

<p>An authority says: "The names <i>species</i> and
<i>genus</i> are merely relative and the same common
term may, in one case, be the species
which is predicated of an individual, and in
another case the individual of which a species
is predicated. Thus the individual, George,
belongs to the logical species Man, while Man
is an individual of the logical species Animal."
Jevons says: "It is desirable to have names
by which to show that one class is contained in
another, and accordingly we call the class
which is divided into two or more smaller ones,
the <i>genus</i>, and the smaller ones into which it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
divided, the <i>species</i>." <i>Animal</i> is a <i>genus</i> of
which <i>man</i> is a <i>species</i>; while <i>man</i>, in turn, is
a <i>genus</i> of which <i>Caucasian</i> is a <i>species</i>; and
<i>Caucasian</i>, in turn, becomes a <i>genus</i> of which
<i>Socrates</i> becomes a species. The student
must avoid confusing the <i>logical</i> meaning of
the terms <i>genus</i> and <i>species</i> with the use of
the same terms in Natural History. <i>Each
class is a "genus" to the class below it in extension;
and each class is a "species" to the
class above it in extension.</i> At the lowest extreme
of the scale we reach what is called the
<i>infima species</i>, which cannot be further subdivided,
as for instance "Socrates"&mdash;this
lowest species must always be an individual
object, person or thing. At the highest extreme
of the scale we reach what is <i>summum
genus</i>, or highest genus, which is never a species
of anything, for there is no class higher
than it, as for instance, "being, existence, reality,
truth, the absolute, the infinite, the ultimate,"
etc. Hyslop says: "In reality there
is but one <i>summum genus</i>, while there may be
an indefinite number of <i>infimae species</i>. All
intermediate terms between these extremes
are sometimes called <i>subalterns</i>, as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
either genera or species, according to the relation
in which they are viewed."</p>

<p>Passing on to the classification of the character
of the <i>intension</i> of terms, we find:</p>

<p><i>Difference</i>, a term denoting: "The mark
or marks by which the species is distinguished
from the rest of the genus; the specific characteristic."
Thus the color of the skin is a
<i>difference</i> between the Negro and the Caucasian;
the number of feet the <i>difference</i> between
the biped and the quadruped; the form
and shape of leaves the <i>difference</i> between the
oak and the elm trees, etc. Hyslop says:
"Whatever distinguishes one object from another
can be called the <i>differentia</i>. It is some
characteristic in addition to the common qualities
and determines the species or individual
under the genus."</p>

<p><i>Property</i>, a term denoting: "A peculiar
quality of anything; that which is inherent in
or naturally essential to anything." Thus a
<i>property</i> is a distinguishing mark of a class.
Thus black skin is a <i>property</i> of the Negro
race; four feet a <i>property</i> of quadrupeds; a
certain form of leaf a <i>property</i> of the oak tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Thus a <i>difference</i> between two species may be
a <i>property</i> of one of the species.</p>

<p><i>Accident</i>, a term denoting: "Any quality
or circumstance which may or may not belong
to a class, accidentally as it were; or, whatever
does not really constitute an essential part of
an object, person or thing." As, for instance,
the redness of a rose, for a rose might part
with its redness and still be a rose&mdash;the color
is the <i>accident</i> of the rose. Or, a brick may
be white and still be a brick, although the majority
of bricks are red&mdash;the redness or whiteness
of the brick are its <i>accidents</i> and not its
essential <i>properties</i>. Whately says: "<i>Accidents</i>
in Logic are of two kinds&mdash;separable
and inseparable. If walking be the <i>accident</i>
of a particular man, it is a separable one, for
he would not cease to be that man though he
stood still; while, on the contrary, if Spaniard
is the <i>accident</i> connected with him, it is an inseparable
one, since he never can cease to be,
ethnologically considered, what he was born."</p>

<p>Arising from the classification of the meaning
or content of terms, we find the process
termed "Definition."</p>

<p><i>Definition</i> is a term denoting: "An expla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>nation
of a word or term." In Logic the term
is used to denote the process of analysis in
which the <i>properties</i> and <i>differences</i> of a term
are clearly stated. There are of course several
kinds of definitions. For instance, there
is what is called a <i>Real Definition</i>, which
Whately defines as: "A definition which explains
the nature of the thing by a particular
name." There is also what is called a <i>Physical
Definition</i>, which is: "A definition made
by enumerating such parts as are actually
separable, such as the hull, masts, etc., of a
ship." Also a <i>Logical Definition</i>, which is:
"A definition consisting of the genus and the
difference. Thus if a planet be defined as 'a
wandering star,' <i>star</i> is the genus, and <i>wandering</i>
points out the difference between a
planet and an ordinary star." An <i>Accidental
Definition</i> is: "A definition of the <i>accidental</i>
qualities of a thing." An <i>Essential Definition</i>
is: "a definition of the essential <i>properties</i>
and <i>differences</i> of an object, person or thing."</p>

<p>Crabbe discriminates between a Definition
and an Explanation, as follows: "A <i>definition</i>
is correct or precise; an <i>explanation</i> is general
or ample. The <i>definition</i> of a word de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>fines
or limits the extent of its signification;
it is the rule for the scholar in the use of any
word; the <i>explanation</i> of a word may include
both definition and illustration; the former
admits of no more words than will include the
leading features in the meaning of any term;
the latter admits of an unlimited scope for
diffuseness on the part of the explainer."</p>

<p>Hyslop gives the following excellent explanation
of the <i>Logical Definition</i>, which as he
states is the proper meaning of the term in
Logic. He states:</p>

<p>"The rules which regulate Logical Definition
are as follows:</p>

<p>1. A definition should state the essential
attributes of the species defined.</p>

<p>2. A definition must not contain the name
of word defined. Otherwise the definition is
called <i>a circulus in definiendo</i>.</p>

<p>3. The definition must be exactly equivalent
to the species defined.</p>

<p>4. A definition should not be expressed in
obscure, figurative, or ambiguous language.</p>

<p>5. A definition must not be negative when
it can be affirmative."</p>

<p>A correct definition necessarily requires the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
manifestation of the two respective processes
of Analysis and Synthesis.</p>

<p><i>Analysis</i> is a term denoting: "The separation
of anything into its constituent elements,
qualities, properties and attributes." It is
seen at once that in order to correctly define
an object, person or thing, it is first necessary
to analyze the latter in order to perceive its
essential and accidental properties or differences.
Unless the qualities, properties and
attributes are clearly and fully perceived, we
cannot properly define the object itself.</p>

<p><i>Synthesis</i> is a term denoting: "The act of
joining or putting two or more things together;
in Logic: the method by composition,
in opposition to the method of resolution or
analysis." In stating a definition we must
necessarily join together the various essential
qualities, properties and attributes, which we
have discovered by the process of analysis;
and the synthesized combination, considered
as a whole, is the definition of the object expressed
by the term.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>JUDGMENTS</small></h2>


<p>The first step in the process of reasoning
is that of Conception or the forming of Concepts.
The second step is that of Judgment,
or the process of perceiving the agreement
or disagreement of two conceptions.</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i> in Logic is defined as: "The comparing
together in the mind of two notions,
concepts or ideas, which are the objects of
apprehension, whether complex or incomplex,
and pronouncing that they agree or disagree
with each other, or that one of them belongs
or does not belong to the other. Judgment is
therefore affirmative or negative."</p>

<p>When we have in our mind two concepts,
we are likely to compare them one with the
other, and to thus arrive at a conclusion regarding
their agreement or disagreement.
This process of comparison and decision is
what, in Logic, is called <i>Judgment</i>.</p>

<p>In every act of Judgment there must be at
least two concepts to be examined and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>pared.
This comparison must lead to a Judgment
regarding their agreement or disagreement.
For instance, we have the two concepts,
<i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i>. We examine and
compare the two concepts, and find that there
is an agreement between them. We find that
the concept <i>horse</i> is included in the higher
concept of <i>animal</i> and therefore, we assert
that: "<i>The horse is an animal.</i>" This is a
statement of <i>agreement</i> and is, therefore, a
<i>Positive Judgment</i>. We then compare the
concepts <i>horse</i> and <i>cow</i> and find a disagreement
between them, which we express in the
statement of the Judgment that: "<i>The horse
is not a cow.</i>" This Judgment, stating a disagreement
is what is called a <i>Negative
Judgment</i>.</p>

<p>In the above illustration of the comparison
between the concepts <i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i> we find
that the second concept <i>animal</i> is broader than
the first, <i>horse</i>, so broad in fact that it includes
the latter. The terms are not equal, for
we cannot say, in truth, that "an animal is the
horse." We may, however, include a <i>part</i> of
the broader conception with the narrower and
say: "some animals are horses." Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
both concepts are of equal rank, as when we
state that: "Man is a rational animal."</p>

<p>In the process of Judgment there is always
the necessity of the choice between the Positive
and the Negative. When we compare the
concepts <i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i>, we must of necessity
decide either that the horse <i>is</i> an animal,
or else that it is <i>not</i> an animal.</p>

<p>The importance of the process of Judgment
is ably stated by Halleck, as follows: "Were
isolated concepts possible, they would be of
very little use. Isolated facts are of no more
service than unspun wool. We might have a
concept of a certain class of three-leaved ivy,
as we might also of poisons. Unless judgment
linked these two concepts and decided
that this species of ivy is poisonous, we might
take hold of it and be poisoned. We might
have a concept of bread and also one of
meat, fruit and vegetables. If we also
had a concept of food, unrelated to these, we
should starve to death, for we should not think
of them as foods. A vessel, supposing itself
to be far out at sea, signaled another vessel
that the crew were dying of thirst. That crew
certainly had a concept of drinkable things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
and also of water. To the surprise of the first,
the second vessel signaled back, 'Draw from
the sea and drink. You are at the mouth of
the Amazon.' The thirsty crew had not
joined the concept <i>drinkable</i> to the concept of
water over the ship's side. A man having
taken an overdose of laudanum, his wife lost
much valuable time in sending out for antidotes,
because certain of her concepts had not
been connected by judgment. She had good
concepts of coffee and of mustard; she also
knew that an antidote to opium was needed;
but she had never linked these concepts and
judged that coffee and mustard were antidotes
to opium. The moment she formed that
judgment she was a wiser woman for her
knowledge was related and usable....
Judgment is the power revolutionizing the
world. The revolution is slow because nature's
forces are so complex, so hard to be reduced
to their simplest forms and so disguised
and neutralized by the presence of other
forces.... Fortunately judgment is ever
silently working and comparing things that,
to past ages, have seemed dissimilar; and it
is continually abstracting and leaving out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the field of view those qualities which have
simply served to obscure the point at issue."</p>

<p>Judgment may be both analytic or synthetic
in its processes; and it may be neither. When
we compare a narrow concept with a broader
one, as a part with a whole, the process is synthetic
or an act of combination. When we
compare a part of a concept with another concept,
the process is analytic. When we compare
concepts equal in rank or extent, the
process is neither synthetic nor analytic. Thus
in the statement that: "A horse is an animal,"
the judgment is synthetic; in the statement
that: "some animals are horses," the judgement
is analytic; in the statement that: "a
man is a rational animal," the judgment is
neither analytic nor synthetic.</p>

<p>Brooks says: "In one sense all judgments
are synthetic. A judgment consists of the
union of two ideas and this uniting is a process
of synthesis. This, however, is a superficial
view of the process. Such a synthesis is a
mere mechanical synthesis; below this is a
thought-process which is sometimes analytic,
sometimes synthetic and sometimes neither
analytic nor synthetic."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>The same authority states: "The act of
mind described is what is known as <i>logical
judgment</i>. Strictly speaking, however, every
intelligent act of the mind is accompanied with
a <i>judgment</i>. To know is to discriminate and,
therefore, to judge. Every sensation or cognition
involves a knowledge and so a judgment
that it exists. The mind cannot think at
all without judging; to think is to judge.
<i>Even in forming the notions which judgment
compares, the mind judges.</i> Every notion or
concept implies a previous act of judgment to
form it: in forming a concept, we compare
the common attributes before we unite them;
and comparison is judgment. It is thus true
that 'Every concept is a contracted judgment;
every judgment an expanded concept.' This
kind of judgment, by which we affirm the
existence of states of consciousness, discriminate
qualities, distinguish percepts and form
concepts, is called <i>primitive or psychological
judgment</i>."</p>

<p>In Logical Judgment there are two aspects;
<i>i.e.</i>, Judgment by Extension and Judgment by
Intension. When we compare the two concepts
<i>horse</i> and <i>animal</i> we find that the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>cept
<i>horse</i> is contained in the concept <i>animal</i>
and the judgment that "<i>a horse is an animal</i>"
may be considered as a Judgment by Extension.
In the same comparison we see that the
concept <i>horse</i> contains the <i>quality of animality</i>,
and in attributing this quality to the <i>horse</i>,
we may also say "<i>the horse is an animal</i>,"
which judgment may be considered as a Judgment
by Intension. Brooks says: "Both
views of Judgment are correct; the mind may
reach its judgment either by extension or by
intension. The method by extension is usually
the more natural."</p>

<p>When a Judgment is expressed in words it
is called a Proposition. There is some confusion
regarding the two terms, some holding
that a Judgment and a proposition are identical,
and that the term "proposition" may be
properly used to indicate the judgment itself.
But the authorities who seek for clearness of
expression and thought now generally hold
that: "<i>A Proposition is a Judgment expressed
in words.</i>" In the next chapter, in which we
consider Propositions, we shall enter into a
more extended consideration of the subject of
Judgments as expressed in Propositions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
which consideration we omit at this point in
order to avoid repetition. Just as the respective
subjects of Concepts and Terms necessarily
blend into each other, so do the respective
subjects of Judgments and Propositions.
In each case, too, there is the element
of the mental process on the one hand
and the verbal expression of it on the other
hand. It will be well to keep this fact in mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>PROPOSITIONS</small></h2>


<p>We have seen that the first step of Deductive
Reasoning is that which we call Concepts.
The second step is that which we call
Propositions.</p>

<p>In Logic, a <i>Proposition</i> is: "A sentence, or
part of a sentence, affirming or denying a connection
between the terms; limited to express
assertions rather than extended to questions
and commands." Hyslop defines a Proposition
as: "any affirmation or denial of an
agreement between two conceptions."</p>

<p><i>Examples of Propositions</i> are found in the
following sentences: "The rose is a flower;"
"a horse is an animal;" "Chicago is a city;"
all of which are affirmations of agreement between
the two terms involved; also in: "A
horse is not a zebra;" "pinks are not roses;"
"the whale is not a fish;" etc., which are
denials of agreement between the terms.</p>

<p>The <i>Parts of a Proposition</i> are: (1) the
<i>Subject</i>, or that of which something is af<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>firmed
or denied; (2) the <i>Predicate</i>, or <i>the
something</i> which is affirmed or denied regarding
the <i>Subject</i>; and (3) the <i>Copula</i>, or the
verb serving as a link between the Subject and
the Predicate.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the Proposition: "Man is an animal,"
the term <i>man</i> is the Subject; the term <i>an animal</i>
is the Predicate; and the word <i>is</i>, is the
Copula. The Copula is always some form of
the verb <i>to be</i>, in the present tense indicative,
in an affirmative Proposition; and the same
with the negative particle affixed, in a negative
Proposition. The Copula is not always
directly expressed by the word <i>is</i> or <i>is not</i>,
etc., but is instead expressed in some phrase
which implies them. For instance, we say "he
runs," which implies "he is running." In
the same way, it may appear at times as if
the Predicate was missing, as in: "God is,"
by which is meant "God is existing." In some
cases, the Proposition is inverted, the Predicate
appearing first in order, and the Subject
last, as in: "Blessed are the peacemakers;"
or "Strong is Truth." In such cases judgment
must be used in determining the matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in accordance with the character and meaning
of the terms.</p>

<p>An <i>Affirmative Proposition</i> is one in which
the Predicate is <i>affirmed</i> to agree with the
Subject. A <i>Negative Proposition</i> is one in
which the agreement of the Predicate and
Subject is <i>denied</i>. Examples of both of these
classes have been given in this chapter.</p>

<p>Another classification of Propositions divides
them in three classes, as follows (1)
Categorical; (2) Hypothetical; (3) Disjunctive.</p>

<p>A <i>Categorical Proposition</i> is one in which
the affirmation or denial is made without
reservation or qualification, as for instance:
"Man is an animal;" "the rose is a flower,"
etc. The fact asserted may not be <i>true</i>, but
the statement is made positively as a statement
of reality.</p>

<p>A <i>Hypothetical Proposition</i> is one in which
the affirmation or denial is made to depend
upon certain conditions, circumstances or suppositions,
as for instance: "If the water is
boiling-hot, it will scald;" or "if the powder
be damp, it will not explode," etc. Jevons
says: "Hypothetical Propositions may gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>erally
be recognized by containing the little
word 'if;' but it is doubtful whether they
really differ much from the ordinary propositions....
We may easily say that 'boiling
water will scald,' and 'damp gunpowder
will not explode,' thus avoiding the use of the
word 'if.'"</p>

<p>A <i>Disjunctive Proposition</i> is one "implying
or asserting an alternative," and usually containing
the conjunction "or," sometimes together
with "either," as for instance: "Lightning
is sheet or forked;" "Arches are either
round or pointed;" "Angles are either obtuse,
right angled or acute."</p>

<p>Another classification of Propositions divides
them in two classes as follows: (1) Universal;
(2) Particular.</p>

<p>A <i>Universal Proposition</i> is one in which the
<i>whole quantity</i> of the Subject is involved in
the assertion or denial of the Predicate. For
instance: "All men are liars," by which is
affirmed that <i>all</i> of the entire race of men are
in the category of liars, not <i>some</i> men but <i>all</i>
the men that are in existence. In the same
way the Proposition: "No men are immortal"
is Universal, for it is a <i>universal denial</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>A <i>Particular Proposition</i> is one in which the
affirmation or denial of the Predicate involves
only a <i>part or portion</i> of the whole of the Subject,
as for instance: "<i>Some</i> men are atheists,"
or "<i>Some</i> women are not vain," in
which cases the affirmation or denial does not
involve <i>all</i> or the <i>whole</i> of the Subject. Other
examples are: "A <i>few</i> men," etc.; "<i>many</i>
people," etc.; "<i>certain</i> books," etc.; "<i>most</i>
people," etc.</p>

<p>Hyslop says: "The signs of the Universal
Proposition, when formally expressed, are
<i>all</i>, <i>every</i>, <i>each</i>, <i>any</i>, <i>and whole</i> or words with
equivalent import." The signs of Particular
Propositions are also certain adjectives of
quantity, such as <i>some</i>, <i>certain</i>, <i>a few</i>, <i>many</i>,
<i>most</i> or such others as denote <i>at least a part</i>
of a class.</p>

<p>The subject of the Distribution of Terms in
Propositions is considered very important by
Logicians, and as Hyslop says: "has much importance
in determining the legitimacy, or at
least the intelligibility, of our reasoning and
the assurance that it will be accepted by
others." Some authorities favor the term,
"Qualification of the Terms of Propositions,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
but the established usage favors the term
"Distribution."</p>

<p>The definition of the Logical term, "Distribution,"
is: "The distinguishing of a universal
whole into its several kinds of species;
the employment of a term to its fullest extent;
the application of a term to its fullest extent,
so as to include all significations or applications."
A Term of a Proposition is <i>distributed</i>
when it is employed in its fullest sense;
that is to say, <i>when it is employed so as to apply
to each and every object, person or thing
included under it</i>. Thus in the proposition,
"All horses are animals," the term <i>horses</i> is
distributed; and in the proposition, "Some
horses are thoroughbreds," the term <i>horses</i> is
not distributed. Both of these examples relate
to the distribution of the <i>subject</i> of the
proposition. But the predicate of a proposition
also may or may not be distributed. For
instance, in the proposition, "All horses are
animals," the predicate, <i>animals</i>, is not distributed,
that is, <i>not used in its fullest sense</i>,
for all <i>animals</i> are not <i>horses</i>&mdash;there are <i>some</i>
animals which are not horses and, therefore,
the predicate, <i>animals</i>, not being used in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
fullest sense is said to be "<i>not distributed</i>."
The proposition really means: "All horses are
<i>some</i> animals."</p>

<p>There is however another point to be remembered
in the consideration of Distribution
of Terms of Propositions, which Brooks expresses
as follows: "Distribution generally
shows itself in the form of the expression, but
sometimes it may be determined by the
thought. Thus if we say, 'Men are mortal,'
we mean <i>all men</i>, and the term men is distributed.
But if we say 'Books are necessary to
a library,' we mean, not 'all books' but 'some
books.' The <i>test of distribution</i> is whether the
term applies to '<i>each and every</i>.' Thus when
we say 'men are mortal,' it is true of each and
every man that he is mortal."</p>

<p>The Rules of Distribution of the Terms of
Proposition are as follows:</p>

<p>1. All <i>universals</i> distribute the <i>subject</i>.</p>

<p>2. All <i>particulars</i> do not distribute the
<i>subject</i>.</p>

<p>3. All <i>negatives</i> distribute the <i>predicate</i>.</p>

<p>4. All <i>affirmatives</i> do not distribute the
<i>predicate</i>.</p>

<p>The above rules are based upon logical rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>soning.
The reason for the first two rules is
quite obvious, for when the subject is <i>universal</i>,
it follows that the <i>whole subject</i> is involved;
when the subject is <i>particular</i> it follows
that <i>only a part</i> of the subject is involved.
In the case of the third rule, it will be seen
that in every <i>negative</i> proposition the <i>whole of
the predicate</i> must be denied the subject, as
for instance, when we say: "Some <i>animals</i> are
<i>not horses</i>," the whole class of <i>horses</i> is cut off
from the subject, and is thus <i>distributed</i>. In
the case of the fourth rule, we may readily see
that in the affirmative proposition the whole
of the predicate <i>is not denied</i> the subject, as
for instance, when we say that: "Horses are
animals," we do not mean that horses are <i>all
the animals</i>, but that they are merely a <i>part or
portion</i> of the class animal&mdash;therefore, the
predicate, <i>animals</i>, is not distributed.</p>

<p>In addition to the forms of Propositions
given there is another class of Propositions
known as <i>Definitive or Substitutive Propositions</i>,
in which the Subject and the Predicate
are exactly alike in extent and rank. For instance,
in the proposition, "A <i>triangle</i> is a
<i>polygon of three sides</i>" the two terms are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>terchangeable;
that is, may be substituted for
each other. Hence the term "substitutive."
The term "definitive" arises from the fact
that the respective terms of this kind of a
proposition necessarily <i>define</i> each other. All
logical definitions are expressed in this last
mentioned form of proposition, for in such
cases the subject and the predicate are precisely
equal to each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>IMMEDIATE REASONING</small></h2>


<p>In the process of Judgment we must compare
two concepts and ascertain their agreement
of disagreement. In the process of
Reasoning we follow a similar method and
compare two judgments, the result of such
comparison being the deduction of a third
judgment.</p>

<p>The simplest form of reasoning is that
known as Immediate Reasoning, by which is
meant the deduction of one proposition from
another which <i>implies</i> it. Some have defined
it as: "<i>reasoning without a middle term</i>."
In this form of reasoning <i>only one proposition
is required for the premise</i>, and from that
premise the conclusion is deduced directly and
without the necessity of comparison with any
other term of proposition.</p>

<p>The two principal methods employed in this
form of Reasoning are; (1) Opposition; (2)
Conversion.</p>

<p><i>Opposition</i> exists between propositions hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ing
the same subject and predicate, but differing
in quality or quantity, or both. The Laws
of Opposition are as follows:</p>

<p>I. (1) If the universal is true, the particular
is true. (2) If the particular is false, the
universal is false. (3) If the universal is
false, nothing follows. (4) If the particular
is true, nothing follows.</p>

<p>II. (1) If one of two contraries is true,
the other is false. (2) If one of two contraries
is false, nothing can be inferred. (3)
Contraries are never both true, but both may
be false.</p>

<p>III. (1) If one of two sub-contraries is
false, the other is true. (2) If one of two sub-contraries
is true, nothing can be inferred concerning
the other. (3) Sub-contraries can
never be both false, but both may be true.</p>

<p>IV. (1) If one of two contradictories is
true, the other is false. (2) If one of two contradictories
is false, the other is true. (3)
Contradictories can never be both true or both
false, but always one is true and the other is
false.</p>

<p>In order to comprehend the above laws, the
student should familiarize himself with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
following arrangement, adopted by logicians
as a convenience:</p>

<table class="ps" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4" summary="data">

  <td class="bt bl bb" rowspan="1">&nbsp;</td>

</table>


<p>Examples of the above: Universal Affirmative
(A): "All men are mortal;" Universal
Negative (E): "No man is mortal;" Particular
Affirmative (I): "Some men are
mortal;" Particular Negative (O): "Some
men are not mortal."</p>

<p>The following examples of abstract propositions
are often used by logicians as tending
toward a clearer conception than examples
such as given above:</p>

<p>(A) "All A is B."</p>

<p>(I) "Some A is B."</p>

<p>(E) "No A is B."</p>

<p>(O) "Some A is not B."</p>

<p>These four forms of propositions bear certain
logical relations to each other, as follows:</p>

<p>A and E are styled <i>contraries</i>. I and O are
<i>sub-contraries</i>; A and I and also E and O are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
called <i>subalterns</i>; A and O and also I and E
are styled <i>contradictories</i>.</p>

<p>A close study of these relations, and the
symbols expressing them, is necessary for a
clear comprehension of the Laws of Opposition
stated a little further back, as well as the
principles of Conversion which we shall mention
a little further on. The following chart,
called the Square of Opposition, is also employed
by logicians to illustrate the relations
between the four classes of propositions:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="350" height="335" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Conversion</i> is the process of immediate
reasoning by which we infer from a given
proposition another proposition having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
predicate of the original for its subject and
the subject of the original for its predicate; or
stated in a few words: <i>Conversion is the
transposition of the subject and predicate of
a proposition</i>. As Brooks states it: "Propositions
or judgments are <i>converted</i> when the
subject and predicate change places in such a
manner that the resulting judgment is an inference
from the given judgment." The new
proposition, resulting from the operation or
Conversion, is called the Converse; the original
proposition is called the Convertend.</p>

<p><i>The Law of Conversion</i> is that: "No term
must be distributed in the Converse that is
not distributed in the Convertend." This
arises from the obvious fact that nothing
should be affirmed in the derived proposition
than there is in the original proposition.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of Conversion; <i>viz</i>:
(1) Simple Conversion; (2) Conversion by
Limitation; (3) Conversion by Contraposition.</p>

<p>In <i>Simple Conversion</i> there is no change in
either quality or quantity. In <i>Conversion by
Limitation</i> the quality is changed from universal
to particular. In Conversion by Nega<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tion
the quality is changed but not the quantity.
Referring to the classification tables
and symbols given in the preceding pages of
this chapter, we may now proceed to consider
the application of these methods of Conversion
to each of the four kinds of propositions;
as follows:</p>

<p><i>The Universal Affirmative</i> (symbol A)
proposition is converted by Limitation, or by
a change of quality from universal to particular.
The predicate not being "distributed" in
the convertend, we must not distribute it in
the converse by saying "<i>all</i>." Thus in this
case we must convert the proposition, "all
men are mortal" (A), into "some mortals are
men" (I).</p>

<p><i>The Universal Negative</i> (symbol E) is converted
by Simple Conversion, in which there
is no change in either quality or quantity. For
since both terms of "E" are distributed, they
may both be distributed in the converse without
violating the law of conversion. Thus
"No man is mortal" is converted into: "No
mortals are men." "E" is converted into
"E."</p>

<p><i>The Particular Affirmative</i> (symbol I) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
also converted by Simple Conversion in which
there is no change in either quality or quantity.
For since neither term is distributed in
"I," neither term may be distributed in the
converse, and the latter must remain "I."
For instance; the proposition: "Some men
are mortal" is converted into the proposition,
"Some mortals are men."</p>

<p><i>The Particular Negative</i> (symbol O) is converted
by Conversion by Negation, in which
the quality is changed but not the quantity.
Thus in converting the proposition: "Some
men are not mortal," we must <i>not</i> say "some
mortals are not men," for in so doing we
would distribute <i>men</i> in the predicate, where
it is not distributed in the convertend. Avoiding
this, <i>we transfer the negative particle from
the copula to the predicate</i> so that the convertend
becomes "I" which is converted by
Simple Conversion. Thus we transfer "Some
men are not mortal" into "Some men are not-mortal"
from which we easily convert (by
simple Conversion) the proposition: "Some
not-mortals are men."</p>

<p>It will be well for students, at this point, to
consider the three following Fundamental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Laws of Thought as laid down by the authorities,
which are as follows:</p>

<p><i>The Law of Identity</i>, which states that:
"The same quality or thing is always the
same quality or thing, no matter how different
the conditions in which it occurs."</p>

<p><i>The Law of Contradiction</i>, which states
that: "No thing can at the same time and
place both be and not be."</p>

<p><i>The Law of Excluded Middle</i>, which states
that: "Everything must either be or not be;
there is no other alternative or middle
course."</p>

<p>Of these laws, Prof. Jevons, a noted authority,
says: "Students are seldom able to see at
first their full meaning and importance. All
arguments may be explained when these self-evident
laws are granted; and it is not too
much to say that the whole of logic will be
plain to those who will constantly use these
laws as the key."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>INDUCTIVE REASONING</small></h2>


<p>Inductive Reasoning, as we have said, is
the process of discovering general truth from
particular truths, or inferring general laws
from particular facts. Thus, from the experience
of the individual and the race regarding
the particular truth that each and every man
under observation has been observed to die
sooner or later, it is inferred that <i>all</i> men die,
and hence, the induction of the general truth
that "All men must die." Or, as from experience
we know that the various kinds of
metals expand when subjected to heat, we infer
that <i>all</i> metals are subject to this law, and
that consequently we may arrive by inductive
reasoning at the conclusion that: "All metals
expand when subjected to heat." It will be
noticed that the conclusion arrived at in this
way by Inductive Reasoning forms the fundamental
premise in the process of Deductive
Reasoning. As we have seen elsewhere, the
two processes, Inductive and Deductive Rea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>soning,
respectively are interdependent&mdash;resting
upon one another.</p>

<p>Jevons says of Inductive Reasoning: "In
Deductive Reasoning we inquire how we may
gather the truth contained in some propositions
called Premises, and put into another
proposition called the Conclusion. We have
not yet undertaken to find out how we can learn
what propositions really are true, but only
<i>what propositions are true when other ones
are true</i>. All the acts of reasoning yet considered
would be called <i>deductive because we
deduce, or lead down the truth from premises
to conclusion</i>. It is an exceedingly important
thing to understand deductive inference correctly,
but it might seem to be still more important
to understand <i>inductive inference</i>, by
which we gather the truth of general propositions
from facts observed as happening in the
world around us." Halleck says: "Man has
to find out through his own experience, or that
of others, the major premises from which he
argues or draws his conclusions. By induction
we examine what seems to us a sufficient
number of individual cases. We then conclude
that the rest of these cases, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
have not examined, will obey the same general
law.... Only after general laws have
been laid down, after objects have been classified,
after major premises have been formed,
can deduction be employed."</p>

<p>Strange as may now appear, it is a fact that
until a comparatively recent period in the
history of man, it was held by philosophers
that the only way to arrive at all knowledge
was by means of Deductive Reasoning, by the
use of the Syllogism. The influence of Aristotle
was great and men preferred to pursue
artificial and complicated methods of Deductive
Reasoning, rather than to reach the truth
by obtaining the facts from Nature herself,
at first hand, and then inferring general principle
from the facts so gathered. The rise of
modern scientific methods of reasoning, along
the lines of Inductive Inference, dates from
about 1225-1300. Roger Bacon was one of the
first to teach that we must arrive at scientific
truth by a process of observation and experimentation
on the natural objects to be found
on all sides. He made many discoveries by
following this process. He was ably seconded
by Galileo who lived some three hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
years later, and who also taught that many
great general truths might be gained by careful
observation and intelligent inference.
Lord Francis Bacon, who lived about the same
time as Galileo, presented in his <i>Novum Organum</i>
many excellent observations and facts
regarding the process of Inductive Reasoning
and scientific thought. As Jevons says: "Inductive
logic inquires by what manner of reasoning
we can gather the laws of nature from
the facts and events observed. Such reasoning
is called induction, or inductive inquiry,
and, as it has actually been practiced by all
the great discoverers in science, it consists in
four steps."</p>

<p>The <i>Four Steps in Inductive Reasoning</i>, as
stated by Jevons, are as follows:</p>

<p><i>First Step.</i>&mdash;Preliminary observation.</p>

<p><i>Second Step.</i>&mdash;The making of hypotheses.</p>

<p><i>Third Step.</i>&mdash;Deductive reasoning.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Step.</i>&mdash;Verification.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the process of Inductive
Reasoning is essentially <i>a synthetic process</i>,
because it operates in the direction of combining
and uniting particular facts or truths into
general truths or laws which comprehend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
embrace and include them all. As Brooks
says: "The particular facts are united by the
mind into the general law; the general law embraces
the particular facts and binds them
together into a unity of principle and thought.
Induction is thus a process of thought from
the parts to the whole&mdash;a synthetic process."
It will also be seen that the process of Inductive
Reasoning is essentially <i>an ascending
process</i>, because it ascends from particular
facts to general laws; particular truths to
universal truths; from the lower to the higher,
the narrower to the broader, the smaller to the
greater.</p>

<p>Brooks says of Inductive Reasoning: "The
relation of induction to deduction will be
clearly seen. Induction and Deduction are
the converse, the opposites of each other. Deduction
derives a particular truth from a
general truth; Induction derives a general
truth from particular truths. This antithesis
appears in every particular. Deduction goes
from generals to particulars; Induction goes
from particulars to generals. Deduction is
an analytic process; Induction is a synthetic
process. Deduction is a descending process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>&mdash;it
goes from the higher truth to the lower
truth; Induction is an ascending process&mdash;it
goes from the lower truth to the higher. They
differ also in that Deduction may be applied
to necessary truths, while Induction is mainly
restricted to contingent truths." Hyslop
says: "There have been several ways of defining
this process. It has been usual to contrast
it with Deduction. Now, deduction is
often said to be reasoning from general to particular
truths, from the containing to the contained
truth, or from cause to effect. Induction,
therefore, by contrast is defined as reasoning
from the particular to the general,
from the contained to the containing, or from
effect to cause. Sometimes induction is said
to be reasoning from the known to the unknown.
This would make deduction, by contrast,
reasoning from the unknown to the
known, which is absurd. The former ways of
representing it are much the better. But
there is still a better way of comparing them.
Deduction <i>is reasoning in which the conclusion
is contained in the premises</i>. This is a ground
for its certitude and we commit a fallacy whenever
we go beyond the premises as shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the laws of the distribution of terms. In contrast
with this, then, we may call inductive
reasoning <i>the process by which we go beyond
the premises in the conclusion</i>.... The
process here is to start from given facts and
to infer some other probable facts more general
or connected with them. In this we see
the process of going beyond the premises.
There are, of course, certain conditions which
regulate the legitimacy of the procedure, just
as there are conditions determining deduction.
They are <i>that the conclusion shall represent
the same general kind as the premises</i>, with a
possibility of accidental differences. But it
goes beyond the premises in so far as <i>known</i>
facts are concerned."</p>

<p>The following example may give you a
clearer idea of the processes of Inductive
Reasoning:</p>

<p><i>First Step.</i> Preliminary Observation. <i>Example</i>:
We notice that all the particular
<i>magnets</i> which have come under our observation
<i>attract iron</i>. Our mental record of the
phenomena may be stated as: "A, B, C, D, E,
F, G, etc., and also X, Y, and Z, all of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
are <i>magnets</i>, in all observed instances, and at
all observed times, <i>attract iron</i>."</p>

<p><i>Second Step.</i> The Making of Hypotheses.
<i>Example</i>: Upon the basis of the observations
and experiments, as above stated, and applying
the axiom of Inductive Reasoning, that:
"What is true of the many, is true of the
whole," we feel justified in forming a hypothesis
or inference of a general law or truth, applying
the facts of the particulars to the general,
whole or universal, thus: "<i>All</i> magnets
attract iron."</p>

<p><i>Third Step.</i> Deductive Reasoning. <i>Example</i>:
Picking up a magnet regarding which we
have had no experience and upon which we
have made no experiments, we reason by the
syllogism, as follows: (1) <i>All</i> magnets attract
iron; (2) <i>This thing</i> is a magnet; therefore
(3) <i>This thing</i> will attract iron. In this we
apply the axiom of Deductive Reasoning:
"Whatever is true of the whole is true of the
parts."</p>

<p><i>Fourth Step.</i> Verification. <i>Example</i>: We
then proceed to test the hypothesis upon the
particular magnet, so as to ascertain whether
or not it agrees with the particular facts. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the magnet does not attract iron we know that
either our hypothesis is wrong and that <i>some</i>
magnets do <i>not</i> attract iron; or else that our
<i>judgment</i> regarding that particular "thing"
being a magnet is at fault and that it is <i>not</i>
a magnet. In either case, further examination,
observation and experiment is necessary.
In case the particular magnet <i>does</i> attract
iron, we feel that we have verified our hypothesis
and our judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>REASONING BY INDUCTION</small></h2>


<p>The term "Induction," in its logical usage,
is defined as follows: "(a) The process of investigating
and collecting facts; and (b) the
deducing of an inference from these facts;
also (c) sometimes loosely used in the sense
of an inference from observed facts." Mill
says: "<i>Induction</i>, then, is that operation of
the mind, by which we infer that what we
know to be true in a particular case or cases,
will be true in all cases which resemble the
former in certain assignable respects. In other
words, <i>Induction</i> is the process by which we
conclude that what is true of certain individuals
of a class, is true of the whole class, or
that what is true at certain times will be
true in similar circumstances at all times."</p>

<p>The <i>Basis of Induction</i> is the axiom that:
"<i>What is true of the many is true of the
whole</i>." Esser, a well known authority, states
this axiom in rather more complicated form,
as follows: "That which belongs or does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
belong to many things of the same kind, belongs
or does not belong to all things of the
same kind."</p>

<p>This basic axiom of Induction rests upon
the conviction that Nature's laws and manifestations
are regular, orderly and <i>uniform</i>.
If we assume that Nature does not manifest
these qualities, then the axiom must fall, and
all inductive reason must be fallacious. As
Brooks well says: "Induction has been compared
to a ladder upon which we ascend from
facts to laws. This ladder cannot stand unless
it has something to rest upon; and this
something is our faith in the constancy of Nature's
laws." Some authorities have held that
this perception of the uniformity of Nature's
laws is in the nature of an <i>intuitive</i> truth, or an
inherent law of our intelligence. Others hold
that it is in itself an <i>inductive</i> truth, arrived
at by experience and observation at a very
early age. We are held to have noticed the
uniformity in natural phenomena, and almost
instinctively infer that this uniformity is continuous
and universal.</p>

<p>The authorities assume the existence of two
kinds of Induction, namely: (1) Perfect In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>duction;
and (2) Imperfect Induction. Other,
but similar, terms are employed by different
authorities to designate these two classes.</p>

<p><i>Perfect Induction</i> necessitates a knowledge
of <i>all</i> the particulars forming a class; that is,
<i>all</i> the individual objects, persons, things or
facts comprising a class must be known and
enumerated in this form of Induction. For
instance, if we <i>knew positively</i> all of Brown's
children, and that their names were John,
Peter, Mark, Luke, Charles, William, Mary
and Susan, respectively; and that each and
every one of them were freckled and had red
hair; then, in that case, instead of simply <i>generalizing</i>
and stating that: "John, Peter,
Mark, Luke, Charles, William, Mary and
Susan, who are <i>all</i> of Brown's children, are
freckled and have red hair," we would save
words, and state the inductive conclusion:
"All Brown's children are freckled and have
red hair." It will be noticed that in this case
<i>we include in the process only what is stated
in the premise itself</i>, and we do not extend our
inductive process beyond the actual data upon
which it is based. This form of Induction is
sometimes called "Logical Induction," be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>cause
the inference is a logical necessity, without
the possibility of error or exception. By
some authorities it is held not to be Induction
at all, in the strict sense, but little more than
a simplified form of enumeration. In actual
practice it is seldom available, for it is almost
impossible for us to know all the particulars
in inferring a general law or truth. In view of
this difficulty, we fall back upon the more
practical form of induction known as:</p>

<p><i>Imperfect Induction</i>, or as it is sometimes
called "Practical Induction," by which is
meant the inductive process of reasoning in
which we assume that the particulars or facts
actually known to us correctly represent those
which are not actually known, and hence the
whole class to which they belong. In this
process it will be seen that <i>the conclusion extends</i>
beyond the data upon which it is based.
In this form of Induction we must actually
employ the principle of the axiom: "What is
true of the many is true of the whole"&mdash;that
is, must <i>assume</i> it to be a fact, not because we
<i>know</i> it by actual experience, but because we
infer it from the axiom which also agrees with
past experience. The conclusion arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
may not always be true in its fullest sense, as
in the case of the conclusion of Perfect Induction,
but is the result of an inference based
upon a principle which gives us a reasonable
right to assume its truth in absence of better
knowledge.</p>

<p>In considering the actual steps in the process
of Inductive Reasoning we can do no better
than to follow the classification of
Jevons, mentioned in the preceding chapter,
the same being simple and readily comprehended,
and therefore preferable in this case
to the more technical classification favored by
some other authorities. Let us now consider
these four steps.</p>

<p><i>First Step.</i> Preliminary observation. It
follows that without the experience of oneself
or of others in the direction of observing and
remembering particular facts, objects, persons
and things, we cannot hope to acquire
the preliminary facts for the generalization
and inductive inference necessary in Inductive
Reasoning. It is necessary for us to form
a variety of clear Concepts or ideas of facts,
objects, persons and things, before we may
hope to generalize from these particulars. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the chapters of this book devoted to the consideration
of Concepts, we may see the fundamental
importance of the formation and acquirement
of correct Concepts. Concepts are
the fundamental material for correct reasoning.
In order to produce a perfect finished
product, we must have perfect materials, and
a sufficient quantity of them. The greater the
knowledge one possesses of the facts and objects
of the outside world, the better able is
he to reason therefrom. Concepts are the raw
material which must feed the machinery of
reasoning, and from which the final product
of perfected thought is produced. As Halleck
says: "There must first be a presentation
of materials. Suppose that we wish to
form the concept <i>fruit</i>. We must first perceive
the different kinds of fruit&mdash;cherry,
pear, quince, plum, currant, apple, fig, orange,
etc. Before we can take the next step, we
must be able to form distinct and accurate
images of the various kinds of fruit. If the
concept is to be absolutely accurate, not one
kind of fruit must be overlooked. Practically
this is impossible; but many kinds should be
examined. Where perception is inaccurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and stinted, the products of thought cannot be
trustworthy. No building is firm if reared on
insecure foundations."</p>

<p>In the process of Preliminary Observation,
we find that there are two ways of obtaining
a knowledge of the facts and things around
us. These two ways are as follows:</p>

<p>I. By <i>Simple Observation</i>, or the perception
of the happenings which are manifested
without our interference. In this way we
perceive the motion of the tides; the movement
of the planets; the phenomena of the
weather; the passing of animals, etc.</p>

<p>II. By the <i>Observation of Experiment</i>, or
the perception of happenings in which we interfere
with things and then observe the result.
An <i>experiment</i> is: "A trial, proof, or
test of anything; an act, operation, or process
designed to discover some unknown truth,
principle or effect, or to test some received
or reputed truth or principle." Hobbes says:
"To have had many <i>experiments</i> is what we
call <i>experience</i>." Jevons says: "Experimentation
is observation with something
more; namely, regulation of the things whose
behavior is to be observed. The advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of experiment over mere observation are of
two kinds. In the first place, we shall generally
know much more certainly and accurately
with what we are dealing, when we make experiments
than when we simply observe natural
events.... It is a further advantage
of artificial experiments, that they enable
us to discover entirely new substances
and to learn their properties.... It
would be a mistake to suppose that the making
of an experiment is inductive reasoning,
and gives us without further trouble the laws
of nature. <i>Experiments only give us the facts
upon which we may afterward reason....</i>
Experiments then merely give facts, and it is
only by careful reasoning that we can learn
when the same facts will be observed again.
<i>The general rule is that the same causes will
produce the same effects.</i> Whatever happens
in one case will happen in all like cases, provided
that they are really like, and not merely
apparently so.... When we have by repeated
experiments tried the effect which all
the surrounding things might have on the result,
we can then reason with much confidence
as to similar results in similar circumstances....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
In order that we may, from our observations
and experiments, learn the law of nature
and become able to foresee the future, we
must perform the process of generalization.
To generalize is to draw a general law from
particular cases, and to infer that what we see
to be true of a few things is true of the whole
genus or class to which these things belong.
It requires much judgment and skill to generalize
correctly, because everything depends
upon the number and character of the instances
about which we reason."</p>

<p>Having seen that the first step in Inductive
Reasoning is Preliminary Observation, let us
now consider the next steps in which we may
see what we do with the facts and ideas which
we have acquired by this Observation and
Experiment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THEORY AND HYPOTHESES</small></h2>


<p>Following Jevons' classification, we find
that the Second Step in Inductive Reasoning
is that called "The Making of Hypotheses."</p>

<p>A <i>Hypothesis</i> is: "A supposition, proposition
or principle <i>assumed or taken for granted</i>
in order to draw a conclusion or inference in
proof of the point or question; a proposition
assumed or taken for granted, though not
proved, for the purpose of deducing proof of
a point in question." It will be seen that a
Hypothesis is merely held to be <i>possibly or
probably true</i>, and <i>not certainly true</i>; it is in
the nature of a <i>working assumption</i>, whose
truth must be tested by observed facts. The
assumption may apply either to the <i>cause</i> of
things, or to the <i>laws</i> which govern things.
Akin to a hypothesis, and by many people
confused in meaning with the latter, is what
is called a Theory.</p>

<p>A <i>Theory</i> is: "A verified hypothesis; a hypothesis
which has been established as, ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>parently,
the true one." An authority says
"<i>Theory</i> is a stronger word than <i>hypothesis</i>.
A <i>theory</i> is founded on principles which have
been established on independent evidence. A
<i>hypothesis</i> merely assumes the operation of a
cause which would account for the phenomena,
but has not evidence that such cause
was actually at work. Metaphysically, a
theory is nothing but a hypothesis supported
by a large amount of probable evidence."
Brooks says: "When a hypothesis is shown
to explain all the facts that are known, these
facts being varied and extensive, it is said to
be verified, and becomes a theory. Thus we
have the theory of universal gravitation, the
Copernican theory of the solar system, the
undulatory theory of light, etc., all of which
were originally mere hypotheses. This is the
manner in which the term is usually employed
in the inductive philosophy; though it
must be admitted that it is not always used
in this strict sense. Discarded hypotheses are
often referred to as theories; and that which
is actually a theory is sometimes called a
hypothesis."</p>

<p>The steps by which we build up a hypothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>sis
are numerous and varied. In the first
place we may erect a hypothesis by the
methods of what we have described as Perfect
Induction, or Logical Induction. In this case
we proceed by simple generalization or simple
enumeration. The example of the freckled,
red-haired children of Brown, mentioned in a
previous chapter, explains this method. It requires
the examination and knowledge of
every object or fact of which the statement
or hypothesis is made. Hamilton states that
it is the only induction which is absolutely
necessitated by the laws of thought. It does not
extend further than the plane of experience.
It is akin to mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>Far more important is the process by which
hypotheses are erected by means of inferences
from Imperfect Induction, by which we reason
from the known to the unknown, transcending
experience, and making true inductive
inferences from the axiom of Inductive Reasoning.
This process involves the subject of
Causes. Jevons says: "The cause of an event
is that antecedent, or set of antecedents, from
which the event always follows. People often
make much difficulty about understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
what the cause of an event means, but it really
means nothing beyond <i>the things that must
exist before in order that the event shall happen
afterward</i>."</p>

<p>Causes are often obscure and difficult to
determine. The following five difficulties are
likely to arise: I. The cause may be out of
our experience, and is therefore not to be understood;
II. Causes often act conjointly,
so that it is difficult to discover the one predominant
cause by reason of its associated
causes; III. Often the presence of a counteracting,
or modifying cause may confuse us;
IV. Often a certain effect may be caused by
either of several possible causes; V. That
which appears as a <i>cause</i> of a certain effect
may be but a co-effect of an original cause.</p>

<p>Mill formulated several tests for ascertaining
the causal agency in particular cases, in
view of the above-stated difficulties. These
tests are as follows: (1) The Method of
Agreement; (2) The Method of Difference;
(3) The Method of Residues; and (4) The
Method of Concomitant Variations. The following
definitions of these various tests are
given by Atwater as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Method of Agreement</i>: "If, whenever a
given object or agency is present without
counteracting forces, a given effect is produced,
there is a strong evidence that the object
or agency is the cause of the effect."</p>

<p><i>Method of Difference</i>: "If, when the supposed
cause is present the effect is present,
and when the supposed cause is absent the
effect is wanting, there being in neither case
any other agents present to effect the result,
we may reasonably infer that the supposed
cause is the real one."</p>

<p><i>Method of Residue</i>: "When in any phenomena
we find a result remaining after the
effects of all known causes are estimated, we
may attribute it to a residual agent not yet
reckoned."</p>

<p><i>Method of Concomitant Variations</i>: "When
a variation in a given antecedent is accompanied
by a variation of a given consequent,
they are in some manner related as cause and
effect."</p>

<p>Atwater adds: "Whenever either of these
criteria is found free from conflicting evidence,
and especially when several of them
concur, the evidence is clear that the cases ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>served
are fair representatives of the whole
class, and warrant a valid inductive conclusion."</p>

<p>Jevons gives us the following valuable
rules:</p>

<p>I. "Whenever we can alter the quantity of
the things experimented on, we can apply <i>a
rule for discovering which are causes and
which are effects</i>, as follows: We must vary
the quantity of one thing, making it at one
time greater and at another time less, and if
we observe any other thing which varies just
at the same times, it will in all probability be
an <i>effect</i>."</p>

<p>II. "When things vary regularly and frequently,
there is <i>a simple rule, by following
which we can judge whether changes are connected
together as causes and effects</i>, as follows:
Those things which change in exactly
equal times are in all likelihood connected together."</p>

<p>III. "It is very difficult to explain how it is
that we can ever reason from one thing to a
class of things by generalization, <i>when we
cannot be sure that the things resemble each
other in the important points</i>.... Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
what grounds do we argue? We have to get
a general law from particular facts. This
can only be done by going through all the
steps of inductive reasoning. Having made
certain observations, we must frame hypotheses
as to the circumstances, or laws from
which they proceed. Then we must reason
deductively; and after verifying the deductions
in as many cases as possible, we shall
know how far we can trust similar deductions
concerning future events.... It is difficult
to judge when we may, and when we may
not, safely infer from some things to others
in this simple way, without making a complete
theory of the matter. <i>The only rule</i> that can
be given to assist us is that <i>if things resemble
each other in a few properties only, we must
observe many instances before inferring that
these properties will always be joined together
in other cases</i>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<small>MAKING AND TESTING HYPOTHESES</small></h2>


<p>The older philosophers and logicians were
often at a loss how to reasonably account for
the origin of hypotheses. It will be seen, after
giving the matter a little thought, that the
actual formation of the hypothesis is more
than a mere grouping together or synthesis
of facts or ideas&mdash;there is another mental
process which actually evolves the hypothesis
or theory&mdash;which gives <i>a possible reason</i>.
What is this mental process? Let us consider
the matter. Brooks well says: "The hypotheses
of science originate in what is called anticipation.
They are not the result of a mere
synthesis of facts, for no combination of facts
can give the law or cause. We do not see the
law; we see the facts and <i>the mind thinks the
law</i>. By the power of anticipation, the mind
often leaps from a few facts to the cause which
produces them or the law which governs
them. Many hypotheses were but <i>a happy intuition
of the mind</i>. They were the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
what La Place calls 'a great guess,' or what
Plato so beautifully designates as 'a sacred
suspicion of truth.' The forming of hypotheses
requires a suggestive mind, a lively fancy,
a philosophic imagination, that catches a
glimpse of the idea through the form, or sees
the law standing behind the fact."</p>

<p>The student of The New Psychology sees
in the mental operation of the forming of the
hypothesis&mdash;"the mind thinking the law"&mdash;but
an instance of the operation of the activities
of the Subconscious Mind, or even the
Superconscious Mind. (See the volume on
the Subconscious Mind in this series.) Not
only does this hypothesis give the explanation
which the old psychology has failed to do,
but it agrees with the ideas of others on the
subject as stated in the above quotation from
Brooks; and moreover agrees with many recorded
instances of the formation of great
hypotheses. Sir Wm. Hamilton discovered
the very important mathematical law of quaternions
while walking one day in the Dublin
Observatory. He had pondered long on the
subject, but without result. But, finally, on
that eventful day he suddenly "felt the gal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>vanic
circle of thought" close, and the result
was the realization of the fundamental mathematical
relations of the problem. Berthelot,
the founder of Synthetic Chemistry, has testified
that the celebrated experiments which led
to his remarkable discoveries were seldom
the result of carefully followed lines of conscious
thought or pure reasoning processes;
but, instead, came to him "of their own accord,"
so to speak, "as from a clear sky."
In these and many other similar instances,
the mental operation was undoubtedly purely
subjective and subconscious. Dr. Hudson
has claimed that the "Subjective Mind" cannot
reason inductively, and that its operations
are purely and distinctly deductive, but
the testimony of many eminent scientists, inventors
and philosophers is directly to the
contrary.</p>

<p>In this connection the following quotation
from Thomson is interesting: "The system
of anatomy which has immortalized the name
of Oken is the consequence of a flash of anticipation
which glanced through his mind
when he picked up in a chance walk the skull
of a deer, bleached and disintegrated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
weather, and exclaimed after a glance, 'It is
part of a vertebral column!' When Newton
saw the apple fall, the anticipatory question
flashed through his mind, 'Why do not the
heavenly bodies fall like this apple?' In
neither case had accident any important
share; Newton and Oken were prepared by
the deepest previous study to seize upon the
unimportant fact offered to them, and to show
how important it might become; and if the
apple and the deer-skull had been wanting,
some other falling body, or some other skull,
would have touched the string so ready to
vibrate. But in each case there was a great
step of anticipation; Oken thought he saw a
type of the whole skeleton in a single vertebra,
while Newton conceived at once that the
whole universe was full of bodies tending to
fall.... The discovery of Goethe, which
did for the vegetable kingdom what Oken did
for the animal, that the parts of a plant are
to be regarded as metamorphosed leaves, is
an apparent exception to the necessity of
discipline for invention, since it was the discovery
of a poet in a region to which he
seemed to have paid no especial or laborious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
attention. But Goethe was himself most anxious
to rest the basis of this discovery upon
his observation rather than his imagination,
and doubtless with good reason.... As
with other great discoveries, hints had been
given already, though not pursued, both of
Goethe's and Oken's principles. Goethe left
his to be followed up by others, and but for his
great fame, perhaps his name would never
have been connected with it. Oken had
amassed all the materials necessary for the
establishment of his theory; he was able at
once to discover and conquer the new territory."</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that all
hypotheses flashing into the field of consciousness
from the Subconsciousness, are necessarily
true or correct. On the contrary many
of them are incorrect, or at least only partially
correct. The Subconsciousness is not infallible
or omniscient&mdash;it merely produces results
according to the material furnished it.
But even these faulty hypotheses are often of
value in the later formation of a correct one.
As Whewell says: "To try wrong guesses
is with most persons the only way to hit upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
right ones." Kepler is said to have erected
at least twenty hypotheses regarding the
shape of the earth's orbit before he finally
evolved the correct one. As Brooks says:
"Even incorrect hypotheses may be of use in
scientific research, since they may lead to
more correct suppositions." The supposition
of the circular motions of the heavenly bodies
around the <i>earth</i> as a center, which lead to
the conception of epicycles, etc., and at last to
the true theory is an illustration of this. So
the 'theory of phlogiston' in chemistry, made
many facts intelligible, before the true one of
'oxidation' superseded it. And so, as Thomson
says, "with the theory that 'Nature abhors
a vacuum,' which served to bring together
so many cognate facts not previously
considered as related. Even an incorrect
conception of this kind has its place in science,
so long as it is applicable to the facts; when
facts occur which it cannot explain, we either
correct it or replace it with a new one. The
pathway of science, some one remarks, is
strewn with the remains of discarded hypotheses."</p>

<p>Halleck says regarding the danger of hasty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
inference: "Men must constantly employ imperfect
induction in order to advance; but
great dangers attend inductive inferences
made from too narrow experience. A child
has experience with one or two dogs at his
home. Because of their gentleness, he argues
that all dogs are gentle. He does not, perhaps,
find out the contrary until he has been
severely bitten. His induction was too hasty.
He had not tested a sufficiently large number
of dogs to form such a conclusion. From one
or two experiences with a large crop in a certain
latitude, a farmer may argue that the
crop will generally be profitable, whereas it
may not again prove so for years. A man
may have trusted a number of people and
found them honest. He concludes that people
as a rule are honest, trusts a certain dishonest
man, and is ruined. The older people
grow, the more cautious they generally become
in forming inductive conclusions. Many
instances are noted and compared; but even
the wisest sometimes make mistakes. It once
was a generally accepted fact that all swans
were white. Nobody had ever seen a dark
swan, and the inference that all swans were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
white was regarded as certainly true. Black
swans were, however, found in Australia."</p>

<p>Brooks says regarding the probability of
hypotheses: "The probability of a hypothesis
is in proportion to the number of facts
and phenomena it will explain. The larger
the number of facts and phenomena that it
will satisfactorily account for, the greater our
faith in the correctness of our supposition.... If
there is more than one hypothesis
in respect to the facts under consideration,
that one which accounts for the greatest
number of facts is the most probable.... In
order to verify a hypothesis it
must be shown that it will account for all the
facts and phenomena. If these facts are
numerous and varied, and the subject is so
thoroughly investigated that it is quite certain
that no important class of facts has been
overlooked, the supposition is regarded as
true, and the hypothesis is said to be verified.
Thus the hypothesis of the 'daily rotation' of
the earth on its axis to account for the succession
of day and night is accepted as absolutely
true. This is the view taken by Dr. Whewell
and many other thinkers in respect to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
verification of a hypothesis. Some writers,
however, as Mill and his school, maintain that
in order to verify a hypothesis, we must show
not only that it explains all the facts and
phenomena, but that there is no other possible
hypothesis which will account for them....
The former view of verification is
regarded as the correct one. By the latter
view, it is evident that a hypothesis could
never be verified."</p>

<p>Jevons says: "In the fourth step (verification),
we proceed to compare these deductions
with the facts already collected, or when necessary
and practicable, we make new observations
and plan new experiments, so as to
find out whether the hypothesis agrees with
nature. If we meet with several distinct disagreements
between our deductions and our
observations, it will become likely that the
hypothesis is wrong, and we must then invent
a new one. In order to produce agreement it
will sometimes be enough to change the hypothesis
in a small degree. When we get hold
of a hypothesis which seems to give results
agreeing with a few facts, we must not at
once assume that it is certainly correct. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
must go on making other deductions from it
under various circumstances, and, whenever
it is possible, we ought to verify these results,
that is, compare them with facts observed
through the senses. When a hypothesis
is shown in this way to be true in a great
many of its results, especially when it enables
us to predict what we should never
otherwise have believed or discovered, it becomes
certain that the hypothesis itself is a
true one.... Sometimes it will happen
that two or even three quite different hypotheses
all seem to agree with certain facts, so that
we are puzzled which to select.... When
there are thus two hypotheses, one as good as
the other, we need to discover some fact or
thing which will agree with one hypothesis
and not with the other, because this immediately
enables us to decide that the former
hypothesis is true and the latter false."</p>

<p>In the above statements regarding the
<i>verification</i> of hypotheses we see references
made to the testing of the latter upon the
"facts" of the case. These <i>facts</i> may be
either the observed phenomena or facts apparent
to the perception, or else <i>facts</i> obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
by deductive reasoning. The latter may be
said to be facts which are held to be true if the
hypothesis be true. Thus if we erect the hypothesis
that "All men are mortal," we may
reason deductively that it will follow that
each and every thing that is a <i>man</i> must die
sooner or later. Then we test our hypotheses
upon <i>each and every man</i> whom we may subject
to observation and experiment. If we
find a single man who does not die, then the
test disproves our hypotheses; if on the contrary
all men (the "facts" in the case) prove
to be mortal, then is our hypotheses proven or
established. The deductive reasoning in this
case is as follows: "<i>If</i> so-and-so is true regarding
such-and-such a class; and if this
particular thing belongs to that class; then it
will follow that so-and-so is true regarding
this particular thing." This argument is expressed
in what is called a Hypothetical
Proposition (see Chapter IX), the consideration
of which forms a part of the general subject
of Deductive Reasoning. Therefore as
Jevons has said, "Deductive Reasoning is the
Third Step in Inductive Reasoning, and precedes
Verification", which we have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
considered. Halleck says: "After Induction
has classified certain phenomena and thus
given us a major premise, we may proceed
<i>deductively</i> to apply the inference to any new
specimen that can be shown to belong to that
class. Induction hands over to deduction a
ready-made major premise.... Deduction
takes that as a fact, making no inquiry
about its truth.... Only after general
laws have been laid down, after objects have
been classified, after major premises have
been formed, can <i>deduction</i> be employed."</p>

<p>In view of the above facts, we shall now
proceed to a consideration of that great class
of Reasoning known under the term&mdash;Deductive
Reasoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>DEDUCTIVE REASONING</small></h2>


<p>We have seen that there are two great
classes of reasoning, known respectively, as
(1) Inductive Reasoning, or the discovery of
general truth from particular truths; and (2)
Deductive Reasoning, or the discovery of particular
truths from general truths.</p>

<p>As we have said, Deductive Reasoning is
the process of discovering particular truths
from a general truth. Thus from the general
truth embodied in the proposition "All
horses are animals," when it is considered in
connection with the secondary proposition
that "Dobbin is a horse," we are able to deduce
the particular truth that: "Dobbin is
an animal." Or, in the following case we
deduce a particular truth from a general
truth, as follows: "All mushrooms are good
to eat; this fungus is a mushroom; therefore,
this fungus is good to eat." A deductive argument
is expressed in a deductive syllogism.</p>

<p>Jevons says regarding the last stated il<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>lustration:
"Here are three sentences which
state three different facts; but when we
know the two first facts, we learn or gather
the third fact from the other two. When
we thus learn one fact from other facts, we
<i>infer or reason</i>, and we do this in the mind.
Reasoning thus enables us to ascertain the
nature of a thing without actual trial. If we
always needed to taste a thing before we could
know whether it was good to eat or not, cases
of poisoning would be alarmingly frequent.
But the appearance and peculiarities of a
mushroom may be safely learned by the eye
or the nose, and reasoning upon this information
and the fact already well known, that
mushrooms are good to eat, we arrive without
any danger or trouble at the conclusion
that the particular fungus before us is good
to eat. <i>To reason, then, is to get some knowledge
from other knowledge.</i>"</p>

<p>The student will recognize that Deductive
Reasoning is essentially <i>an analytic process</i>,
because it operates in the direction of analyzing
a universal or general truth into its particulars&mdash;into
the particular parts which are
included within it&mdash;and asserting of them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
"what is true of the general is true of the
particular." Thus in the general truth that
"All men are mortal," we see included the
particular truth that "John Smith is mortal"&mdash;John
Smith having been discovered to be a
man. We deduce the particular truth about
John Smith from the general truth about "all
men." We analyze "all men" and find John
Smith to be one of its particular parts.
Therefore, "Deduction is an inference from
the whole to its parts; that is, an analytic
process."</p>

<p>The student will also recognize that Deductive
Reasoning is essentially <i>a descending
process</i>, because it operates in the direction of
a descent from the universal to the particular;
from the higher to the lower; from the
broader to the narrower. As Brooks says:
"Deduction descends from higher truths to
lower truths, from laws to facts, from causes
to phenomena, etc. Given the law, we can
by deduction descend to the facts that fall
under the law, even if we have never before
seen the facts; and so from the cause we may
pass down to observed and even unknown
phenomena."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>The general truths which are used as the
basis of Deductive Reasoning are discovered
in several ways. The majority arise from Inductive
Reasoning, based upon experience,
observation and experiment. For instance in
the examples given above, we could not truthfully
assert our belief that: "All horses are
animals" unless we had previously studied
both the horse and animals in general. Nor
without this study could we state that "Dobbin
is a horse." Nor could we, without previous
study, experience and experiment truthfully
assert that: "All mushrooms are good
to eat;" or that "this fungus is a mushroom;"
and that "therefore, this fungus is
good to eat." Even as it is, we must be sure
that the fungus really is a mushroom, else we
run a risk of poisoning ourselves. General
truths of this kind are <i>not intuitive</i>, by any
means, but are based upon our own experience
or the experience of others.</p>

<p>There is a class of general truths which are
called <i>intuitive</i> by some authorities. Halleck
says of these: "Some psychologists claim
that we have knowledge obtained neither
through induction nor deduction; that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
recognize certain truths the moment we perceive
certain objects, without any process of
inference. Under the head of intuitive knowledge
are classified such cases as the following:
We perceive an object and immediately
know that it is a time relation, as existing now
and then. We are said to have an intuitive
concept of time. When we are told that the
whole is greater than a part; that things equal
to the same thing are equal to each other; that
a straight line cannot enclose space, we <i>immediately</i>,
or intuitively, recognize the truth of
these statements. Attempts at proof do not
make us feel surer of their truth....
We say that it is self-evident, or that we know
the fact intuitively. The axioms of mathematics
and logic are said to be intuitive."</p>

<p>Another class of authorities, however, deny
the nature of intuitive knowledge of truth, or
intuitive truths. They claim that all our ideas
arise from sensation and reflection, and that
what we call "intuition" is merely the result
of sensation and reflection <i>reproduced by
memory or heredity</i>. They hold that the <i>intuitions</i>
of animals and men are simply the
representation of experiences of the race, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
individual, arising from the impressions
stored away in the subconsciousness of the
individual. Halleck states regarding this:
"This school likens intuition to instinct. It
grants that the young duck knows water instinctively,
plunges into it, and swims without
learning. These psychologists believe that
there was a time when this was not the case
with the progenitors of the duck. They had
to gain this knowledge slowly through experience.
Those that learned the proper
aquatic lesson survived and transmitted this
knowledge through a modified structure, to
their progeny. Those that failed in the lesson
perished in the struggle for existence....
This school claims that the intuition
of cause and effect arose in the same way.
Generations of human beings have seen the
cause invariably joined to the effect; hence,
through inseparable association came the
recognition of their necessary sequence. The
tendency to regard all phenomena in these
relations was with steadily increasing force
transmitted by the laws of heredity to posterity,
until the recognition of the relationship
has become an intuition."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Another class of general truths is merely
hypothetical. Hypothetical means "Founded
on or including a hypothesis or supposition;
assumed or taken for granted, though
not proved, for the purpose of deducing
proofs of a point in question." The hypotheses
and theories of physical science are used
as general truths for deductive reasoning.
Hypothetical general truths are in the nature
of premises assumed in order to proceed with
the process of Deductive Reasoning, and
without which such reasoning would be impossible.
They are, however, as a rule not
mere assumptions, but are rather in the nature
of assumptions rendered plausible by
experience, experiment and Inductive Reasoning.
The Law of Gravitation may be considered
hypothetical, and yet it is the result
of Inductive Reasoning based upon a vast
multitude of facts and phenomena.</p>

<p>The <i>Primary Basis of Deductive Reasoning</i>
may be said to rest upon the logical axiom,
which has come down to us from the ancients,
and which is stated as follows: "<i>Whatever
is true of the whole is true of its parts</i>." Or,
as later authorities have expressed it: "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>ever
is true of the general is true of the particular."
This axiom is the basis upon which
we build our Deductive Reasoning. It furnishes
us with the validity of the deductive
inference or argument. If we are challenged
for proof of the statement that "This fungus
is good to eat," we are able to answer that
we are justified in making the statement by
the self-evident proposition, or axiom, that
"Whatever is true of the general is true of
the particular." If the general "mushroom"
is good to eat, then the particular, "this fungus"
being a mushroom, must also be good to
eat. All horses (general) being animals,
then according to the axiom, Dobbin (particular
horse) must also be an animal.</p>

<p>This axiom has been stated in various terms
other than those stated above. For instance:
"Whatever may be affirmed or denied of the
whole, may be denied or affirmed of the
parts;" which form is evidently derived
from that used by Hamilton who said: "What
belongs, or does not belong, to the containing
whole, belongs or does not belong, to each of
the contained parts." Aristotle formulated
his celebrated Dictum as follows: "What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ever
can be predicated affirmatively or negatively
of any class or term distributed, can be
predicated in like manner of all and singular
the classes or individuals contained under it."</p>

<p>There is another form of Deductive Reasoning,
that is a form based upon another axiom
than that of: "Whatever is true of the
whole is true of the parts." This form of
reasoning is sometimes called Mathematical
Reasoning, because it is the form of reasoning
employed in mathematics. Its axiom is
stated as follows: "Things which are equal
to the same thing, are equal to one another."
It will be seen that this is the principle employed
in mathematics. Thus: "x equals y;
and y equals 5; therefore, x equals 5." Or
stated in logical terms: "A equals B; B
equals C; therefore, A equals C." Thus it is
seen that this form of reasoning, as well as
the ordinary form of Deductive Reasoning, is
strictly <i>mediate</i>, that is, made through the
medium of a third thing, or "two things being
compared through their relation to a third."</p>

<p>Brooks states: "The real reason for the
certainty of mathematical reasoning may be
stated as follows: First, its ideas are defi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>nite,
necessary, and exact conceptions of
quantity. Second, its definitions, as the description
of these ideas are necessary, exact,
and indisputable truths. Third, the axioms
from which we derive conclusions by comparison
are all self-evident and necessary truths.
Comparing these exact ideas by the necessary
laws of inference, the result must be absolutely
true. Or, stated in another way, using
these definitions and axioms as the premises
of a syllogism, the conclusion follows inevitably.
There is no place or opportunity for
error to creep in to mar or vitiate our derived
truths."</p>

<p>In conclusion, we wish to call your attention
to a passage from Jevons which is
worthy of consideration and recollection.
Jevons says: "There is a simple rule which
will enable us to test the truth of a great many
arguments, even of many which do not come
under any of the rules commonly given in
books on logic. This rule is that <i>whatever is
true of one term is true of any term which is
stated to be the same in meaning as that term</i>.
In other words, we may always <i>substitute one
term for another if we know that they refer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
exactly the same thing</i>. There is no doubt
that a horse is some animal, and therefore the
head of a horse is the head of some animal.
This argument cannot be brought under the
rules of the syllogism, because it contains
four distinct logical terms in two propositions;
namely, horse, some animal; head of
horse, head of some animal. But it easily
comes under the rule which I have given, because
we have simply to put 'some animal' instead
of 'a horse'. A great many arguments
may be explained in this way. Gold is a
metal; therefore a piece of gold is a piece of
metal. A negro is a fellow creature; therefore,
he who strikes a negro, strikes a fellow
creature."</p>

<p>The same eminent authority says: "When
we examine carefully enough the way in which
we reason, it will be found <i>in every case to
consist in putting one thing or term in place of
another, to which we know it to have an exact
resemblance in some respect</i>. We use the
likeness as a kind of bridge, which leads us
from a knowledge of one thing to a knowledge
of another; thus <i>the true principle of reasoning
may be called the substitution of similars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
or the passing from like to like</i>. We infer the
character of one thing from the character of
something which acts as a go-between, or
third term. When we are certain there is an
exact likeness, our inference is certain; when
we only believe that there probably is, or
guess that there is, then our inferences are
only probable, not certain."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<small>THE SYLLOGISM</small></h2>


<p>The third and highest phase or step in
reasoning&mdash;the step which follows after those
styled Conception and Judgment&mdash;is generally
known by the general term "Reasoning,"
which term, however, is used to include the
two precedent steps as well as the final step
itself. This step or process consists of the
comparing of two objects, persons or things,
through their relation to a third object, person
or thing. As, for instance, we reason (a)
that all mammals are animals; (b) that a
horse is a mammal; and (c) that, <i>therefore</i>, a
horse is an animal. The most fundamental
principle of this step or reasoning consists in
the comparing of two objects of thought
through and by means of their relation to a
third object. The natural form of expression
of this process of reasoning is called a "Syllogism."</p>

<p>The process of reasoning which gives rise
to the expression of the argument in the form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of a Syllogism must be understood if one
wishes to form a clear conception of the Syllogism.
The process itself is very simple when
plainly stated, although the beginner is sometimes
puzzled by the complicated definitions
and statements of the authorities. Let us suppose
that we have three objects, A, B and C,
respectively. We wish to compare C and B,
but fail to establish a relation between them
at first. We however are able to establish a
relation between A and B; and between C and
A. We thus have the two propositions (1)
"A equals B; and (2) C equals A". The
next step is that of inferring that "if A equals
B, and C equals A, then it must follow, logically,
<i>that C equals B</i>." This process is that
of indirect or mediate comparison, rather
than <i>immediate</i>. C and B are not compared
directly or immediately, but indirectly and
through the medium of A. A is thus said to
<i>mediate</i> between B and C.</p>

<p>This process of reasoning embraces three
ideas or objects of thought, in their expression
of propositions. It comprises the fundamental
or elemental form of reasoning. As
Brooks says: "The simplest movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
reasoning process is the comparing of two
objects through their relation to a third."
The result of this process is an argument expressed
in what is called a Syllogism. Whately
says that: "A Syllogism is an argument
expressed in strict logical form so that its
conclusiveness is manifest from the structure
of the expression alone, without any regard
to the meaning of the terms." Brooks says:
"All reasoning can be and naturally is expressed
in the form of the syllogism. It applies
to both inductive and deductive reasoning,
and is the form in which these processes
are presented. Its importance as an instrument
of thought requires that it receive special
notice."</p>

<p>In order that the nature and use of the
Syllogism may be clearly understood, we can
do no better than to at once present for your
consideration the well-known "Rules of the
Syllogism," an understanding of which
carries with it a perfect comprehension of the
Syllogism itself.</p>

<p>The Rules of the Syllogism state that in
order for a Syllogism to be a <i>perfect</i> Syllogism,
it is necessary:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>I. <i>That there should be three, and no more
than three, Propositions.</i> These three propositions
are: (1) the <i>Conclusion</i>, or thing to
be proved; and (2 and 3) the Premises, or the
means of proving the Conclusion, and which
are called the Major Premise and Minor Premise,
respectively. We may understand this
more clearly if we will examine the following
example:</p>

<p><i>Major Premise</i>: "Man is mortal;" (or "A
is B").</p>

<p><i>Minor Premise</i>: "Socrates is a man;" (or
"C is A"). Therefore:</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i>: "Socrates is mortal" (or "C
is B").</p>

<p>It will be seen that the above Syllogism,
whether expressed in words or symbols, is
logically valid, because the conclusion must
logically follow the premises. And, in this
case, the premises being true, it must follow
that the conclusion is true. Whately says:
"A Syllogism is said to be valid when the conclusion
logically follows from the premises;
if the conclusion does not so follow, the Syllogism
is invalid and constitutes a Fallacy, if
the error deceives the reasoner himself; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
if it is advanced with the idea of deceiving
others it constitutes a Sophism."</p>

<p>The reason for Rule I is that only three
propositions&mdash;a Major Premise, a Minor
Premise, and a Conclusion&mdash;are needed to
form a Syllogism. If we have more than
<i>three</i> propositions, then we must have more
than two premises from which to draw one
conclusion. The presence of more than two
premises would result in the formation of
two or more Syllogisms, or else in the failure
to form a Syllogism.</p>

<p>II. <i>That there should be three and no more
than three Terms.</i> These Terms are (1) The
Predicate of the Conclusion; (2) the Subject
of the Conclusion; and (3) the Middle Term
which must occur in both premises, being the
connecting link in bringing the two other
Terms together in the Conclusion.</p>

<p>The <i>Predicate of the Conclusion</i> is called
the <i>Major</i> Term, because it is the greatest in
extension compared with its fellow terms.
The <i>Subject of the Conclusion</i> is called the
<i>Minor</i> Term because it is the smallest in extension
compared with its fellow terms. The
Major and Minor Terms are called the <i>Extremes</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
The Middle Term operates between
the two Extremes.</p>

<p>The <i>Major Term</i> and the <i>Middle Term</i> must
appear in the <i>Major Premise</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Minor Term</i> and the <i>Middle Term</i> must
appear in the <i>Minor Premise</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Minor Term</i> and the <i>Major Term</i> must
appear in the <i>Conclusion</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we see that <i>The Major Term</i> must be
the Predicate of the Conclusion; the <i>Minor
Term</i> the Subject of the Conclusion; the <i>Middle
Term</i> may be the Subject or Predicate <i>of
either of the premises</i>, but <i>must always be
found once in both premises</i>.</p>

<p>The following example will show this arrangement
more clearly:</p>

<p>In the Syllogism: "Man is mortal; Socrates
is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal,"
we have the following arrangement: "Mortal,"
the Major Term; "Socrates," the
Minor Term; and "Man," the Middle Term;
as follows:</p>

<p><i>Major Premise</i>: "Man" (<i>middle term</i>) is
mortal (<i>major term</i>).</p>

<p><i>Minor Premise</i>: "Socrates" (<i>minor term</i>)
is a man (<i>major term</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i>: "Socrates" (<i>minor term</i>) is
mortal (<i>major term</i>).</p>

<p>The reason for the rule that there shall be
"<i>only three</i>" terms is that reasoning consists
in comparing <i>two terms</i> with each other
through the medium of a <i>third term</i>. There
<i>must be</i> three terms; if there are <i>more</i> than
three terms, we form two syllogisms instead
of one.</p>

<p>III. <i>That one premise, at least, must be
affirmative.</i> This, because "from two negative
propositions nothing can be inferred."
A negative proposition asserts that two things
differ, and if we have two propositions so asserting
difference, we can infer nothing from
them. If our Syllogism stated that: (1)
"Man is <i>not</i> mortal;" and (2) that "Socrates
is <i>not</i> a man;" we could form no Conclusion,
either that Socrates <i>was</i> or <i>was not</i> mortal.
There would be no logical connection
between the two premises, and therefore no
Conclusion could be deduced therefrom.
Therefore, at least one premise must be affirmative.</p>

<p>IV. <i>If one premise is negative, the conclusion
must be negative.</i> This because "if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
term agrees and another disagrees with a
third term, they must disagree with each
other." Thus if our Syllogism stated that:
(1) "Man is <i>not</i> mortal;" and (2) that: "Socrates
is a man;" we must announce the Negative
Conclusion that: (3) "Socrates is <i>not</i>
mortal."</p>

<p>V. <i>That the Middle Term must be distributed;
(that is, taken universally) in at least
one premise.</i> This "because, otherwise, the
Major Term may be compared with one part
of the Middle Term, and the Minor Term with
another part of the latter; and there will be
actually no common Middle Term, and consequently
no common ground for an inference."
The violation of this rule causes what is commonly
known as "The Undistributed Middle,"
a celebrated Fallacy condemned by the
logicians. In the Syllogism mentioned as an
example in this chapter, the proposition "<i>Man</i>
is mortal," really means "<i>All</i> men," that is,
Man in his universal sense. Literally the proposition
is "All men are mortal," from which
it is seen that Socrates being "<i>a</i> man" (or
<i>some</i> of <i>all</i> men) must partake of the quality
of the universal Man. If the Syllogism, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>stead,
read: "<i>Some</i> men are mortal," it
would not follow that Socrates <i>must</i> be mortal&mdash;he
might or might not be so. Another form
of this fallacy is shown in the statement that
(1) White is a color; (2) Black is a color;
hence (3) Black must be White. The two premises
<i>really</i> mean "White is <i>some</i> color;
Black is <i>some</i> color;" and not that either is
"<i>all</i> colors." Another example is: "Men are
bipeds; birds are bipeds; hence, men are
birds." In this example "bipeds" is not distributed
as "<i>all</i> bipeds" but is simply not-distributed
as "<i>some</i> bipeds." These syllogisms,
therefore, not being according to rule,
must fail. They are not true syllogisms, and
constitute fallacies.</p>

<p>To be "<i>distributed</i>," the Middle Term must
be the Subject of a Universal Proposition, or
the Predicate of a Negative Proposition; to
be "<i>undistributed</i>" it must be the Subject of
a Particular Proposition, or the Predicate of
an Affirmative Proposition. (See chapter on
Propositions.)</p>

<p>VI. <i>That an extreme, if undistributed in a
Premise, may not be distributed in the Conclusion.</i>
This because it would be illogical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
unreasonable to assert more in the conclusion
than we find in the premises. It would be
most illogical to argue that: (1) "All horses
are animals; (2) no man is a horse; therefore
(3) no man is an animal." The conclusion
would be invalid, because the term <i>animal</i>
is distributed in the conclusion, (being
the predicate of a negative proposition) while
it is not distributed in the premise (being the
predicate of an affirmative proposition).</p>

<p>As we have said before, any Syllogism
which violates any of the above six syllogisms
is invalid and a fallacy.</p>

<p>There are two additional rules which may
be called derivative. Any syllogism which
violates either of these two derivative rules,
also violates one or more of the first six rules
as given above in detail.</p>

<p>The <i>Two Derivative Rules of the Syllogism</i>
are as follows:</p>

<p>VII. <i>That one Premise at least must be
Universal.</i> This because "from two particular
premises no conclusion can be drawn."</p>

<p>VIII. <i>That if one premise is Particular, the
Conclusion must be particular also.</i> This be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>cause
only a universal conclusion can be
drawn from two universal premises.</p>

<p>The principles involved in these two Derivative
Rules may be tested by stating Syllogisms
violating them. They contain the essence
of the other rules, and every syllogism
which breaks them will be found to also break
one or more of the other rules given.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<small>VARIETIES OF SYLLOGISMS</small></h2>


<p>The authorities in Logic hold that with the
four kinds of propositions grouped in every
possible order of arrangement, it is possible
to form nineteen different kinds of valid arguments,
which are called the <i>nineteen moods
of the syllogism</i>. These are classified by division
into what are called <i>the four figures</i>,
each of which figures may be known by the position
of the middle term in the premises. Logicians
have arranged elaborate and curious
tables constructed to show what kinds of propositions
when joined in a particular order of
arrangement will make sound and valid syllogisms.
We shall not set forth these tables
here, as they are too technical for a popular
presentation of the subject before us, and because
they are not necessary to the student
who will thoroughly familiarize himself with
the above stated Laws of the Syllogism and
who will therefore be able to determine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
every case whether any given argument is a
correct syllogism, or otherwise.</p>

<p>In many instances of ordinary thought and
expression the <i>complete</i> syllogistic form is
omitted, or not stated at full length. It is common
usage to omit one premise of a syllogism,
in ordinary expression, the missing premise
being inferred by the speaker and hearer. A
syllogism with one premise unexpressed is
sometimes called an <i>Enthymene</i>, the term
meaning "in the mind." For instance, the
following: "We are a free people, therefore
we are happy," the major premise "All free
people are happy" being omitted or unexpressed.
Also in "Poets are imaginative,
therefore Byron was imaginative," the minor
premise "Byron was a poet" is omitted or unexpressed.
Jevons says regarding this phase
of the subject: "Thus in the Sermon on the
Mount, the verses known as the Beatitudes
consist each of one premise and a conclusion,
and the conclusion is put first. 'Blessed are
the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.'
The subject and the predicate of the conclusion
are here inverted, so that the proposition
is really 'The merciful are blessed.' It is ev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>idently
<i>understood</i> that 'All who shall obtain
mercy are blessed,' so that the syllogism, when
stated at full length, becomes: 'All who shall
obtain mercy are blessed; All who are merciful
shall obtain mercy; Therefore, all who are
merciful are blessed.' This is a perfectly
good syllogism."</p>

<p>Whenever we find any of the words: "<i>because</i>,
<i>for</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>since</i>," or similar terms,
we may know that there is an argument, and
usually a syllogism.</p>

<p>We have seen that there are three special
kinds of Propositions, namely, (1) Categorical
Propositions, or propositions in which the
affirmation or denial is made without reservation
or qualification; (2) Hypothetical
Propositions, in which the affirmation or denial
is made to depend upon certain conditions,
circumstances, or suppositions; and (3)
Disjunctive Propositions, in which is implied
or asserted an <i>alternative</i>.</p>

<p>The forms of reasoning based upon these
three several classes of propositions bear the
same names as the latter. And, accordingly
the respective syllogisms expressing these
forms of reasoning also bear the class name or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
term. Thus, a Categorical Syllogism is one
containing only categorical propositions; a
Hypothetical Syllogism is one containing one
or more hypothetical propositions; a Disjunctive
Syllogism is one containing a disjunctive
proposition in the major premise.</p>

<p><i>Categorical Syllogisms</i>, which are far more
common than the other two kinds, have been
considered in the previous chapter, and the
majority of the examples of syllogisms given
in this book are of this kind. In a Categorical
Syllogism the statement or denial is made positively,
and without reservation or qualification,
and the reasoning thereupon partakes of
the same positive character. In propositions
or syllogisms of this kind it is asserted or assumed
that the premise is true and correct,
and, if the reasoning be logically correct it
must follow that the conclusion is correct, and
the new proposition springing therefrom must
likewise be Categorical in its nature.</p>

<p><i>Hypothetical Syllogisms</i>, on the contrary,
have as one or more of their premises a hypothetical
proposition which affirms or asserts
something provided, or "if," something else
be true. Hyslop says of this: "Often we wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
first to bring out, if only conditionally, the
truth upon which a proposition rests, so as to
see if the connection between this conclusion
and the major premise be admitted. The whole
question will then depend upon the matter of
treating the minor premise. This has the advantage
of getting the major premise admitted
without the formal procedure of proof,
and the minor premise is usually more easily
proved than the major. Consequently, one is
made to see more clearly the force of the argument
or reasoning by removing the question
of the material truth of the major premise
and concentrating attention upon the relation
between the conclusion and its conditions, so
that we know clearly what we have first to
deny if we do not wish to accept it."</p>

<p>By joining a hypothetical proposition with
an ordinary proposition we create a Hypothetical
Proposition. For instance: "<i>If</i>
York contains a cathedral it is a city; York
<i>does</i> contain a cathedral; therefore, York is a
city." Or: "If <i>dogs</i> have four feet, they are
quadrupeds; dogs <i>do</i> have four feet; therefore
dogs <i>are</i> quadrupeds." The Hypothetical
Syllogism may be either affirmative or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
negative; that is, its hypothetical proposition
may either hypothetically <i>affirm</i> or hypothetically
<i>deny</i>. The part of the premise of a Hypothetical
Syllogism which conditions or questions
(and which usually contains the little
word "if") is called the Antecedent. The major
premise is the one usually thus conditioned.
The other part of the conditioned proposition,
and which part states what will happen
or is true under the conditional circumstances,
is called the Consequent. Thus, in one of the
above examples: "If dogs have four feet" is
the Antecedent; and the remainder of the
proposition: "they are quadrupeds" is the
Consequent. The Antecedent is indicated by
the presence of some conditional term as: <i>if</i>,
<i>supposing</i>, <i>granted that</i>, <i>provided that</i>, <i>although</i>,
<i>had</i>, <i>were</i>, etc., the general sense and
meaning of such terms being that of the little
word "<i>if</i>." The Consequent has no special
indicating term.</p>

<p>Jevons gives the following clear and simple
<i>Rules regarding the Hypothetical Syllogism</i>:</p>

<p>I. "If the Antecedent be affirmed, the consequent
may be affirmed. If the Consequent
be denied, the Antecedent may be denied."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>II. "Avoid the fallacy of affirming the
consequent, or denying the antecedent. This
is a fallacy because of the fact that the conditional
statement made in the major premise
<i>may not be the only one</i> determining the consequent."
The following is an example of
"Affirming the Consequent:" "<i>If</i> it is raining,
the sky is overclouded; the sky <i>is</i> overclouded;
therefore, it <i>is raining</i>." In truth,
the sky may be overclouded, and still it may
<i>not</i> be raining. The fallacy is still more apparent
when expressed in symbols, as follows:
"<i>If</i> A is B, C is D; C <i>is</i> D; therefore, A is B."
The fallacy of denying the Antecedent is
shown by the following example: "<i>If</i> Radium
were cheap it would be useful; Radium
is <i>not</i> cheap; therefore Radium <i>is not</i> useful."
Or, expressed in symbols: "<i>If</i> A is B, C is D;
A is <i>not</i> B; therefore C <i>is not</i> D." In truth
Radium may be useful although not cheap.
Jevons gives the following examples of these
fallacies: "If a man is a good teacher, he
thoroughly understands his subject; but John
Jones thoroughly understands his subject;
therefore, he is a good teacher." Also, "If
snow is mixed with salt it melts; the snow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
the ground is <i>not</i> mixed with salt; therefore
it does <i>not</i> melt."</p>

<p>Jevons says: "To affirm the consequent
and then to infer that we can affirm the antecedent,
is as bad as breaking the third rule of
the syllogism, and allowing an undistributed
middle term.... To deny the antecedent
is really to break the fourth rule of the
syllogism, and to take a term as distributed in
the conclusion which was not so in the premises."</p>

<p>Hypothetical Syllogisms may usually be
easily reduced to or converted into Categorical
Syllogisms. As Jevons says: "In reality,
hypothetical propositions and syllogisms are
not different from those which we have more
fully considered. <i>It is all a matter of the convenience
of stating the propositions.</i>" For instance,
instead of saying: "If Radium were
cheap, it would be useful," we may say
"Cheap Radium would be useful;" or instead
of saying: "If glass is thin, it breaks easily,"
we may say "Thin glass breaks easily." Hyslop
gives the following <i>Rule for Conversion</i>
in such cases: "Regard the antecedent of the
hypothetical proposition as the subject of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
categorical, and the consequent of the hypothetical
proposition as the predicate of the
categorical. In some cases this change is a
very simple one; in others it can be effected
only by a circumlocution."</p>

<p>The third class of syllogisms, known as <i>The
Disjunctive Syllogism</i>, is the exception to the
law which holds that all good syllogisms must
fit in and come under the Rules of the Syllogism,
as stated in the preceding chapter. Not
only does it refuse to obey these Rules, but it
fails to resemble the ordinary syllogism in
many ways. As Jevons says: "It would be
a great mistake to suppose that all good logical
arguments must obey the rules of the syllogism,
which we have been considering. Only
those arguments which connect two terms together
by means of a middle term, and are
therefore syllogisms, need obey these rules.
A great many of the arguments which we
daily use are of this nature; but there are a
great many other kinds of arguments, some of
which have never been understood by logicians
until recent years. One important kind of argument
is known as the Disjunctive Syllogism,
though it does not obey the rules of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
syllogism, or in any way resemble syllogisms."</p>

<p>The Disjunctive Syllogism is one having a
disjunctive proposition in its major premise.
The disjunctive proposition also appears in
the conclusion when the disjunction in the major
premise happens to contain more than two
terms. A disjunctive proposition, we have
seen, is one which possesses alternative predicates
for the subject in which the conjunction
"<i>or</i>" (sometimes accompanied by "<i>either</i>")
appears. As for instance: "Lightning is sheet
<i>or</i> forked;" or, "Arches are <i>either</i> round or
pointed;" or, "Angles are either obtuse, or
right angled, or acute." The different things
joined together by "or" are called Alternatives,
the term indicating that we may choose
between the things, and that if one will not
answer our purpose we may take the other, or
one of the others if there be more than one
<i>other</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Rule regarding the Use of Disjunctive
Syllogisms</i> is that: "If one or more alternatives
be denied, the rest may still be affirmed."
Thus if we say that "A is B or C," or that "A
is either B or C," we may <i>deny</i> the B but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
affirm the C. Some authorities also hold that
"If we affirm one alternative, we must deny
the remainder," but this view is vigorously
disputed by other authorities. It would seem
to be a valid rule in cases where the term
"either" appears as: "A is <i>either</i> B <i>or</i> C,"
because there seems to be an implication that
one or the other alone can be true. But in
cases like: "A is B <i>or</i> C," there may be a possibility
of <i>both being true</i>. Jevons takes this
latter view, giving as an example the proposition:
"A Magistrate is a Justice-of-the-Peace,
a Mayor, or a Stipendiary Magistrate,"
but it does not follow that one who is
a Justice-of-the-Peace may not be at the same
time a Mayor. He states: "After affirming
one alternative we can only deny the others <i>if
there be such a difference between them that
they could not be true at the same time</i>." It
would seem that both contentions are at the
same time true, the example given by Jevons
illustrating his contention, and the proposition
"The prisoner is either guilty or innocent"
illustrating the contentions of the other
side.</p>

<p>A <i>Dilemma</i> is a conditional syllogism whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Major Premise presents some sort of alternative.
Whately defines it as: "A conditional
syllogism with two or more antecedents in the
major, and a disjunctive minor." There being
two mutually exclusive propositions in the
Major Premise, the reasoner is compelled to
admit one or the other, and is then caught between
"the two horns of the dilemma."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>REASONING BY ANALOGY</small></h2>


<p>What is called Reasoning by Analogy is one
of the most elementary forms of reasoning,
and the one which the majority of us most frequently
employ. It is a primitive form of
hasty generalization evidencing in the natural
expectation that "things will happen as they
have happened before in like circumstances."
The term as used in logic has been defined as
"Resemblance of relations; Resemblances of
any kind on which an argument falling short
of induction may be founded." Brooks says:
"Analogy is that process of thought by which
we infer that if two things resemble each
other in one or more particulars, they will resemble
each other in some other particular."</p>

<p>Jevons states the <i>Rule for Reasoning by
Analogy</i>, as follows: "If two or more things
resemble each other in many points, they will
probably resemble each other also in more
points." Others have stated the same principle
as follows: "When one thing resembles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
another in known particulars, it will resemble
it also in the unknown;" and "If two things
agree in several particulars, they will also
agree in other particulars."</p>

<p>There is a difference between generalization
by induction, and by analogy. In inductive
generalization the rule is: "What is true of
the many is true of all;" while the rule of
analogy is: "things that have some things in
common have other things in common." As
Jevons aptly remarks: "Reasoning by Analogy
differs only in degree from that kind of
reasoning called 'Generalization.' When
<i>many things</i> resemble each other in a <i>few
properties</i>, we argue about them by Generalization.
When a <i>few things</i> resemble each
other in <i>many properties</i>, it is a case of analogy."
Illustrating Analogy, we may say that
if in A we find the qualities, attributes or
properties called <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, respectively,
and if we find that in B the qualities, etc.,
called <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, respectively, are present,
then we may reason by analogy that the qualities
<i>f</i> and <i>g</i> must also belong to B.</p>

<p>Brooks says of this form of reasoning:
"This principle is in constant application in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
ordinary life and in science. A physician, in
visiting a patient, says this disease corresponds
in several particulars with typhoid fever,
hence it will correspond in <i>all</i> particulars,
and <i>is</i> typhoid fever. So, when the geologist
discovers a fossil animal with large, strong,
blunt claws, he infers that it procured its food
by scratching or burrowing in the earth. It
was by analogy that Dr. Buckland constructed
an animal from a few fossil bones, and when
subsequently the bones of the entire animal
were discovered, his construction was found
to be correct." Halleck says: "In argument
or reasoning we are much aided by the
habit of searching for hidden resemblances.... The
detection of such a relation cultivates
thought. If we are to succeed in argument,
we must develop what some call a sixth
sense of such relations.... The study
of poetry may be made very serviceable in detecting
analogies and cultivating the reasoning
powers. When the poet brings clearly to
mind the change due to death, using as an illustration
the caterpillar body transformed
into the butterfly spirit, moving with winged
ease over flowering meadows, he is cultivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
our apprehension of relations, none the less
valuable because they are beautiful."</p>

<p>But the student must be on guard against
the deceptive conclusions sometimes arising
from Reasoning by Analogy. As Jevons says:
"In many cases Reasoning by Analogy is
found to be a very uncertain guide. In some
cases unfortunate mistakes are made. Children
are sometimes killed by gathering and
eating poisonous berries, wrongly inferring
that they can be eaten, because other berries,
of a somewhat similar appearance, have been
found agreeable and harmless. Poisonous
toadstools are occasionally mistaken for mushrooms,
especially by people not accustomed to
gathering them. In Norway mushrooms are
seldom seen, and are not eaten; but when I
once found a few there and had them cooked
at an inn, I was amused by the people of the
inn, who went and collected toadstools and
wanted me to eat them also. This was clearly
a case of mistaken reasoning by analogy.
Even brute animals reason in the same way in
some degree. The beaten dog fears every
stick, and there are few dogs which will not
run away when you pretend to pick up a stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
even if there be no stone to pick up." Halleck
says: "Many false analogies are manufactured,
and it is excellent thought training to
expose them. The majority of people think
so little that they swallow these false analogies
just as newly fledged robins swallow
small stones dropped into their open mouths....
This tendency to think as others do
must be resisted somewhere along the line, or
there can be no progress." Brooks says:
"The argument from Analogy is plausible,
but often deceptive. Thus to infer that since
American swans are white, the Australian
swan is white, gives a false conclusion, for it
is really black. So to infer that because John
Smith has a red nose and is a drunkard, then
Henry Jones who also has a red nose is also a
drunkard, would be a dangerous inference....
Conclusions of this kind drawn from
analogy are frequently fallacious."</p>

<p>Regarding the <i>Rule for Reasoning from
Analogy</i>, Jevons says: "There is no way in
which we can really assure ourselves that we
are arguing safely by analogy. The only rule
that can be given is this; that the more closely
two things resemble each other, the more like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>ly
it is that they are the same in other respects,
especially in points closely connected with
those observed.... In order to be clear
about our conclusions, we ought in fact never
to rest satisfied with mere analogy, but ought
to try to discover the general laws governing
the case. In analogy we seem to reason from
one fact to another fact without troubling ourselves
either with deduction or induction. But
it is only by a kind of guess that we do so; it is
not really conclusive reasoning. We ought
properly to ascertain what general laws of nature
are shown to exist by the facts observed,
and then infer what will happen according to
these laws.... We find that reasoning
by analogy is not to be depended upon, unless
we make such an inquiry into the causes and
laws of the things in question, that we really
employ inductive and deductive reasoning."</p>

<p>Along the same lines, Brooks says: "The
inference from analogy, like that from induction,
should be used with caution. Its conclusion
must not be regarded as certain, but
merely as reaching a high degree of probability.
The inference from a part to a part, no
more than from a part to the whole, is attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>ed
with any rational necessity. To attain certainty,
we must show that the principles which
lie at the root of the process are either necessary
laws of thought or necessary laws of nature;
both of which are impossible. Hence
analogy can pretend to only a high degree of
probability. It may even reach a large degree
of certainty, but it never reaches necessity.
We must, therefore, be careful not to
accept any inference from analogy as true until
it is proved to be true by actual observation
and experiment, or by such an application of
induction as to remove all reasonable doubt."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<small>FALLACIES</small></h2>


<p>A <i>Fallacy</i> is: "An unsound argument or
mode of arguing, which, while appearing to
be decisive of a question, is in reality not so;
an argument or proposition apparently sound,
but really fallacious; a fallacious statement or
proposition, in which the error is not apparent,
and which is therefore likely to mislead
or deceive; sophistry."</p>

<p>In Deductive Reasoning, we meet with two
classes of Fallacies; namely, (1) Fallacious
Premise; and (2) Fallacious Conclusion. We
shall now consider each of these in turn.</p>

<p><i>Fallacious Premise</i> is in effect <i>an unwarranted
assumption of premises</i>. One of the
most common forms of this kind of Fallacy is
known as "<i>Begging the Question</i>," the principle
of which is the assumption of a fundamental
premise which is not conceded; the unwarrantable
assumption of that which is to be
proved; or the assumption of that by which it
is to be proved, without proving it. Its most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
common form is that of boldly stating some unproven
fact, authoritatively and positively,
and then proceeding to use the statement as
the major premise of the argument, proceeding
logically from that point. The hearer perceiving
the argument proceeding logically often
fails to remember that <i>the premise has been
merely assumed</i>, without warrant and without
proof and omitting the hypothetical "<i>if</i>."
One may proceed to argue logically from the
premise that "The moon is made of green
cheese," but the whole argument is invalid
and fallacious because of the fact that the person
making it has "begged the question"
upon an unwarranted premise. Hyslop gives
a good example of this form of fallacy in the
case of the proposition "Church and State
should be united." Proof being demanded the
advocate proceeds to "beg the question" as
follows: "Good institutions should be united;
Church and State are good institutions; therefore,
Church and State should be united." The
proposition that "Good institutions should be
united" is fallacious, being merely assumed
and not proven. The proposition sounds reasonable,
and few will feel disposed to dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
it at first, but a little consideration will show
that while <i>some</i> good institutions may well be
united, it is <i>not</i> a general truth that <i>all</i> should
be so.</p>

<p>"Begging the Question" also often arises
from <i>giving a name to a thing</i>, and then assuming
that we have <i>explained</i> the thing. This
is a very frequent practice with many people&mdash;they
try to <i>explain</i> by merely applying
names. An example of this kind is had in the
case of the person who tried to explain why
one could see through a pane of glass by saying
"because it is transparent." Or when
one explains that the reason a certain substance
breaks easily is "because it is brittle."
Moliere makes the father of a dumb girl ask
why his daughter is dumb. The physician
answers: "Nothing is more easy than to explain
it; it comes from her having lost the
power of speech." "Yes, yes," objects the
father, "but the cause, if you please, why she
has lost the power of speech." The physician
gravely replies: "All our best authors will
tell you that it is the impeding of the action of
the tongue."</p>

<p>Jevons says: "The most frequent way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
perhaps, in which we commit this kind of fallacy
is to employ names which imply that we
disapprove of something, and then argue that
because it is such and such, it must be condemned.
When two sportsmen fall out in
some manner relating to the subject of game,
one will, in all probability, argue that the act
of the other was 'unsportsmanlike,' and therefore
should not have been done. Here is to all
appearance a correct syllogism:</p>

<p>"No unsportsmanlike act should be done;
John Robinson's act was unsportsmanlike:
Therefore, John Robinson's act should not
have been done.</p>

<p>"This is quite correct in form; but it is evidently
the mere semblance of an argument.
'Unsportsmanlike' means <i>what a sportsman
should not do</i>. The point to be argued was
whether the act fell within the customary
definition of <i>what was unsportsmanlike</i>."</p>

<p>Arising from "Begging the Question," and
in fact a class of the latter, is what is called
"Reasoning in a Circle." In this form of fallacy
one assumes as proof of a proposition the
proposition itself; or, uses the conclusion to
prove the premise. For instance: "This man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
is a rascal because he is a rogue; and he is a
rogue because he is a rascal." Or, "It is warm
because it is summer; and it is summer because
it is warm." Or "He never drinks to
excess, because he is never intemperate in
drinking."</p>

<p>Brooks says: "Thus to argue that a party
is good because it advocates good measures,
and that certain measures are good because
they are advocated by so excellent a party, is
to reason in a circle. So when persons argue
that their church is the true one, because it
was established by God, and then argue that
since it is the true church it must have been
founded by God, they fall into this fallacy. To
argue that 'the will is determined by the
strongest motive' and to define the strongest
motive as 'that which influences the will,' is
to revolve in a circle of thought and prove
nothing. Plato commits this error when he
argues the immortality of the soul from its
simplicity, and afterwards attempts to prove
its simplicity from its immortality." It needs
care to avoid this error, for it is surprising
how easily one falls into it. Hyslop says:
"The fallacy of Reasoning in a Circle occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
mostly in long arguments where it can be committed
without ready detection....
When it occurs in a long discourse it may be
committed without easy discovery. It is likely
to be occasioned by the use of synonyms
which are taken to express more than the conception
involved when they do not." What is
called a Vicious Circle is caused when the conclusion
of one syllogism is used for a proposition
in another syllogism, which in its turn
comes to be used as a basis for the first or
<i>original syllogism</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fallacious Conclusion</i> is in effect <i>an unwarranted
or irrelevant assumption of a logical
conclusion</i>. There are many forms of this
fallacy among which are the following:</p>

<p><i>Shifting ground</i>, which consists in the pretence
of proving one thing while in reality
merely a similar or related thing is being
proved. In this class is the argument that because
a man is profane he must necessarily be
dishonest; or that because a man denies the
inspiration of the Scriptures he must be an
atheist.</p>

<p><i>Fallacious Questioning</i>, in which two or
more related questions are asked, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
answer of one is then applied to the other. For
instance: "You assert that the more civilized a
community, the more silk-hats are to be found
in it?" "Yes." "Then, you state that silk-hats
are the promoters and cause of civilization
in a community?" A question of this kind
is often so arranged that an answer either in
the affirmative or the negative will lead to a
false or fallacious inference. For instance,
the question once asked a respectable citizen
on the witness stand: "Have you stopped
beating your mother?" An answer of either
"Yes" or "No," was out of the question, for
it would have placed the witness in a false position,
for he had never beaten his mother, nor
been accused of the same.</p>

<p><i>Partial Proof</i>, in which the proof of a partial
or related fact is used to infer a proof of
the whole fact or a related one. For instance,
it is fallacious to argue that a man has been
guilty of drunkenness by merely proving that
he was seen entering a saloon.</p>

<p><i>Appeal to Public Opinion</i>, in which the prejudices
of the public are appealed to rather
than its judgment or reason. In politics and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
theological argument this fallacy is frequent.
It is no argument, and is reprehensible.</p>

<p><i>Appeal to Authority, or Reverence</i>, in which
the reverence and respect of the public for certain
persons is used to influence their feelings
in place of their judgment or reason. For instance:
"Washington thought so-and-so, and
therefore it must be right;" or "It is foolish
to affirm that Aristotle erred;" or "It has
been believed by men for two thousand years,
that, etc;" or "What our fathers believed
must be true." Appeals of this kind may have
their proper place, but they are fallacies
nevertheless, and not real argument.</p>

<p><i>Appeal to Profession</i>, in which an appeal is
made to practices, principles or professions of
the opponent, rather than to reason or judgment.
Thus we may argue that a certain philosophy
or religion cannot be sound or good,
because certain people who hold it are not consistent,
or not worthy, moral or sober. This
argument is often used effectively against an
opponent, and is valid against him personally.
But it is no valid argument against his philosophy
or belief, because he may act in violation
of them, or he may change his practices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
still adhere to his beliefs&mdash;the two are not
joined.</p>

<p><i>Appeal to General Belief</i>, in which an appeal
is made to general or universal belief, although
the same may be unsupported by
proof. This is quite common, but is no real
argument. The common opinion may be erroneous,
as history proves. A few centuries ago
this argument could have been used in favor
of the earth being flat, etc. A half-century ago
it was used against Darwin. Today it is being
used against other new ideas. It is a fallacy
by its very nature.</p>

<p><i>Appeal to Ignorance</i>, in which an appeal is
made to the ignorance of the opponent that his
conviction may follow from his inability to
prove the contrary. It is virtually no argument
that: "So-and-so must be true, <i>because
you cannot prove that it is not</i>." As Brooks
says: "To argue that there is no material
world, because we cannot explain how the
mind knows it to exist, is the celebrated fallacy
of Hume in philosophy. The fact that we
cannot find a needle in a haystack is no proof
that it is not there."</p>

<p><i>Introduction of New Matter</i>, also called <i>Non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Sequitur</i>, in which matter is introduced into
the conclusion that is not in the premises.
Hyslop gives the following example of it:
"All men are <i>rational</i>; Socrates is a man;
therefore, Socrates is <i>noble</i>." De Morgan
gives the following more complex example:
"Episcopacy is of Scripture origin; The
Church of England is the only Episcopal
church in England; therefore, the church established
is the church that ought to be supported."</p>

<p>Other fallacies, resembling in some respects
those above mentioned, are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Fallacy of Ambiguous Terms</i>, in which different
meanings of the same word are used to
produce the fallacious argument. As Jevons
says: "A word with two distinct meanings <i>is
really two words</i>."</p>

<p><i>Confusion between Collective and General
Meanings of a Term</i>, of which Jevons says:
"It would be obviously absurd to argue that
because <i>all</i> the books in the British Museum
Library are sure to give information about
King Alfred, therefore any particular book
will be sure to give it. By '<i>all</i> the books in the
British Museum Library,' we mean all <i>taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
together</i>. There are many other cases where
the confusion is not so evident, and where
great numbers of people are unable to see the
exact difference."</p>

<p><i>Arguing from the Collective to the General</i>,
in which the fallacy consists of arguing that
because something is true of the whole of a
group of things, therefore it is true of any of
those things. Jevons says: "<i>All</i> the soldiers
in a regiment may be able to capture a town,
but it is absurd to suppose that therefore
<i>every</i> soldier in the regiment could capture
the town single handed. White sheep eat a
great deal more than black sheep; but that is
because there are so many more of them."</p>

<p><i>Uncertain Meaning of a Sentence</i>, from
which confusion arises and fallacious argument
may spring. Jevons says: "There is a
humorous way of proving that a cat must have
three tails: Because a cat has one tail more
than <i>no</i> cat; and <i>no cat</i> has two tails; therefore,
<i>any</i> cat has three tails." Here the fallacy
rests upon a <i>punning</i> interpretation of
"no."</p>

<p><i>Proving the Wrong Conclusion</i>, in which the
attempt to confuse conclusions is made, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the result that some people will imagine that
the case is established. Jevons says: "This
was the device of the Irishman, who was
charged with theft on the evidence of three
witnesses, who had seen him do it; he proposed
to call <i>thirty</i> witnesses who had <i>not</i> seen
him do it. Equally logical was the defense of
the man who was called a materialist, and who
replied, 'I am not a materialist; I am a barber.'"</p>

<p><i>Fallacy of Unsuccessful Argument</i>, in which
is attempted the illogical conclusion that <i>because
a certain argument has failed the opposite
conclusion is proven</i>. This fallacy is quite
common, especially in cases of juries. One
side fails to prove certain contentions, and the
jury leaps to the conclusion that the opposite
contention must be correct. This is clearly
fallacious, for there is always the possibility
of a <i>third</i> explanation. In the case of a claim
of <i>alibi</i> juries are apt to fall into this fallacy.
The failure of the attempt to establish an <i>alibi</i>
is often held to be in the nature of proof of the
guilt of the accused. Old trial lawyers assert
that a failure to establish a claimed <i>alibi</i> tends
to injure the chance of the accused more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
direct evidence against him. Yet, as all logical
reasoners will see, there is no logical validity
in any such inference. As Jevons has well
said: "<i>No number of failures in attempting
to prove a proposition really disprove it</i>." At
the end of each failure the case simply stands
in the same position as before the attempt;
<i>i.e.</i>, "not proven."</p>

<p><i>All Violations of the Rules of the Syllogism</i>
constitute fallacies, as may be seen by forming
a syllogism in violation of one or more of the
rules.</p>

<p>The logicians, particularly those of ancient
times, took great pains to discover and <i>name</i>
new variations of fallacies, many of which
were hair-splitting in nature, and not worthy
of being considered seriously. Some of those
which we have enumerated may possibly be
open to the same criticism, but we have omitted
many of the worst offenders against practical
common sense. An understanding of the
fundamental Laws of Reasoning is sufficient
to expose and unmask all fallacies, and such
understanding is far more valuable than the
memorizing of the <i>names</i> of hair-splitting fallacies
which would not deceive a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the above stated fallacies of
Deductive Reasoning, there are other fallacies
which are met with in <i>Inductive Reasoning</i>.
Let us briefly consider them.</p>

<p><i>Hasty and False Generalization</i> is a common
fallacy of this class. Persons sometimes
see certain qualities in a few individuals of a
class, and mistakenly infer that <i>all</i> the individuals
in that class must possess these same
qualities. Travelers frequently commit this
fallacy. Englishmen visiting the United
States for a few weeks have been known to
publish books upon their return home making
the most ridiculous generalizations regarding
the American people, their assertions being
based upon the observation of a few scattered
individuals, often not at all representative.
Americans traveling abroad commit similar
errors. A flying trip through a country does
not afford the proper opportunity for correct
generalization. As Brooks says: "No hypothesis
should be accepted as true until the
facts are so numerous that there can be no
doubt of its being proved."</p>

<p><i>Fallacies of Observation</i> result from incorrect
methods of observation among which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
be mentioned the following: (1) <i>Careless Observation</i>,
or inexact perception and conception;
(2) <i>Partial Observation</i>, in which one observes
only a part of the thing or fact, omitting
the remainder, and thus forming an incomplete
and imperfect concept of the thing
or fact; (3) <i>Neglect of Exceptions and Contradictory
Facts</i>, in which the exceptions and
contradictory facts are ignored, thereby giving
undue importance to the observed facts;
(4) <i>Assumption of Facts</i> which are not real
facts, or the assumption of the truth of things
which are untrue; (5) <i>Confusing of Inferences
with Facts</i>, which is most unwarrantable.</p>

<p><i>Fallacies of Mistaken Cause</i> result from the
assumption of a thing as a cause, when it is not
so, of which the following are familiar examples:
<i>Substituting the Antecedent for the
Cause</i>, which consists in assuming a mere antecedent
thing for a <i>cause</i> of another thing.
Thus one might assume that the crowing of
the cock was the <i>cause</i> of daybreak, because it
<i>preceded</i> it; or that a comet was the cause of
the plague which followed its appearance; or
in the actual case in which a child reasoned
that doctors <i>caused</i> deaths, because observa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>tion
had shown that they always visited persons
before they died; or that crops failed because
a President of a certain political party
had been inaugurated a few months before.
Some fallacies of everyday reasoning are
quite as illogical as those just mentioned. <i>Substituting
the Symptom for the Cause</i>, which
consists in assuming as a <i>cause</i> some mere
symptom, sign or incident of the real cause.
To assume that the pimples of measles were
the <i>cause</i> of the disease, would be to commit a
fallacy of this kind. We have mentioned elsewhere
the fallacy which would assume silk-hats
to be the cause of Civilization, instead of
being a mere incident of the latter. Politicians
are fond of assuming certain incidents or
signs of a period, as being the <i>causes</i> of the
prosperity, culture and advancement of the
period, or the reverse. One might argue, with
equal force, that automobiles were the causes
of national prosperity, pointing to the fact
that the more automobiles to be seen the better
the times. Or, that straw hats produced hot
weather, for similar reasons.</p>

<p><i>The Fallacy of Analogy</i> consists in assuming
a resemblance or identity, where none ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>ists.
We have spoken of this in another chapter.
Brooks says, also: "It is a fallacy to
carry an analogy too far; as to infer from the
parable of the praying of the importunate
woman that God resembles the unjust judge."</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would call your attention
to the following words from Jevons, in which
he expresses the gist of the matter: "It is impossible
too often to remind people that, on
the one hand, <i>all correct reasoning consists in
substituting like things for like things</i>, and inferring
that what is true of one will be true of
all which are similar to it in the points of resemblance
concerned in the matter. On the
other hand, <i>all incorrect reasoning consists in
putting one thing for another where there is
not the requisite likeness</i>. It is the purpose of
the rules of deductive and inductive logic to
enable us to judge as far as possible when we
are thus rightly or wrongly reasoning from
some things to others."</p>
